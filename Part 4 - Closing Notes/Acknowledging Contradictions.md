# Acknowledging Contradictions

* Stories of healthy nation cruelty to enemies

* Language -- Zapatistas talk about having "authorities"[xxx-ezln ramona san crist] and Martín Prechtel describes "lords and ladies" in the Tzutujil Maya.

* pull examples from ODOC

Many different explanations for these.

A brief summary would include:

* many healthy nations were forced to change their way of life after extended contact with unhealthy nations. For example, Haudenosaunee acknowledged needing to trade in hides to get guns to protect themselves, no longer treating the nonhumans as they would have wanted.

  Stories from this book come from traditional times, before extended contact with unhealthy nations. For example, the Cherokee culture began changing substantially after 1750, even though the Cherokee Trail of Tears didn't occur until the 1830s.

  When people of healthy nations have faced endless violence and deceit from colonists and conquering armies, many of them described how this affected the balance in their culture and changed their way of life dramatically, even during the years when they could successfully defend themselves.

  Many stories Euro-Americans have from people of healthy nations come from this time when they could no longer live as they traditionally wanted.

  Learning how to maintain a healthy nation while surrounded by unhealthy nations is a major challenge.

### Studying Healthy Nations takes Care

I have found four major epochs when studying humans, and to learn the deepest lessons from healthy nations, it really helps to know which epoch is being studied.

* _1) Traditional times:_ How a healthy nation lived before extended contact with unhealthy nations.

* _2) After extended contact with unhealthy nations, before being conquered (non-traditional but sovereign):_ Healthy nations can still protect territory and defend themselves, but endless military and paramilitary violence, corruption, and propaganda of unhealthy nations affects the healthy nations' culture. For example, Cherokee culture began changing substantially around 1750 as they had more intense contact with European unhealthy nations and more consistent exposure to violence, though their Trail of Tears forced march to Oklahoma didn't happen until the 1830s.[xxx-basket interview]

* _3) After being conquered, but people remember their healthy-nation ancestral traditions (the healthy nation lives but is not sovereign):_ In this epoch, people preserve and embrace ancient wisdom the best they can while subject to an unhealthy nation's laws, such as present-day Okanaga[xxx-original instructions|armstrong] and Haudenosaunee in Canada and the United States.[xxx-cite] As Chapter 3 shows, many healthy nations still stand in solidarity with the Earth today even as they're subject to an unhealthy nation's laws. The indigenous nations that came together as the Zapatistas persevered in this state for five centuries before their revolution in 1994. 

* _4) When memory of a person's healthy-nation ancestors has been forgotten (the healthy nation is dead):_ most people alive today are in this state, having totally forgotten their ancestors who lived in healthy nations. Their unhealthy nation and its discrimination, corruption, greed, and pollution seem "just the way life is."

Students of healthy nations can be confused for many reasons, such as European and American propaganda that minimized their own atrocities and embellished or fabricated stories of healthy nations' atrocities.[xxx-odoc|ch22] In addition, many healthy nations in North and South America struggled to maintain their way of life after extended contact with unhealthy nations, and the need to maintain security in the face of endless European violence and weapons caused severe challenges for many healthy nations. When people study healthy nations in this period of extended contact, they are essentially studying a nation as it responds to a never-ending crisis, and so they don't learn how the healthy nation lived in traditional times.

For example, the Haudenosaunee writers described how, in the 1700s, they felt a need to acquire European guns to protect themselves from Europeans, so they started killing animals more aggressively to get fur for trade.[xxx-basic call|furs] This need for self-protection affected how they treated the nonhumans, and it created security imbalances with other nearby healthy nations, including the Huron, who were in conflict with the Haudenosaunee.

When the Haudenosaunee became better armed due to this trade, the Huron became more vulnerable, and they began capturing Haudenosaunee people and torturing them to death to try to scare them away.[xxx-huron farms|P24] This shows how the viciousness of war increased and the security situation became more unstable as each healthy nation responded the best they could to the arrival of unhealthy nations and their more powerful military technology and endless waves of soldiers filled with deceitful propaganda.

The Huron and Haudenosaunee remained healthy nations as they kept that baseline of mutual respect internally, but they changed aspects of their way of life as they adapted to the deteriorating security situation, corruption, propaganda, and other pressures from unhealthy nations. This has been a common experience around the world, with each healthy nation, healthy community, and person choosing how to respond to these pressures in their own way.

This book does not address the security requirements for maintaining a sovereign healthy nation in present times, except to acknowledge these issues are very real, as the Zapatistas showed in Chapters 12. This book focuses on stories and perspectives from healthy nations as they lived in traditional times in order to learn the deepest lessons for how humans can live in a good way with each other.

There is good news. Centuries ago, healthy nations often did not understand the threat posed by unhealthy nations until it was too late. Ancient conflicts between healthy nations only made it easier for unhealthy nations to overpower them. But this wouldn't happen today, as unhealthy nations are the clear overwhelming threat to healthy nations around the world.
