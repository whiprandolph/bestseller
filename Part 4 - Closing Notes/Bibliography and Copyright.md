## Bibliography and Copyright

_The Deepest Revolution_ is based off the research used to create my first book _One Disease One Cure_. Almost all stories and quotes in _The Deepest Revolution_ are included in _One Disease One Cure_, which contains an extensive bibliograph with over 720 entries and over 1,200 citations.

To keep _The Deepest Revolution_ as compact and approachable as possible, I chose not to include a bibliography or citations. However, I carefully cited all quotes and stories in _One Disease One Cure_, so if you wish to track down sources, you can do so in that book.
