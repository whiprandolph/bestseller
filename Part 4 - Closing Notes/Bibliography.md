## Bibliography

_The Deepest Revolution_ is based off the research used to create my first book _One Disease One Cure_. Almost all stories and quotes in _The Deepest Revolution_ are included there, which contains an extensive bibliography with over 720 entries and over 1,200 citations.

To keep _The Deepest Revolution_ as compact, inexpensive and approachable as possible, I chose not to include a bibliography or citations. However, I carefully cited all quotes, stories, and facts in _One Disease One Cure_, so if you wish to track down sources, you can do so in that book. The simplest way to find a citation is to download the free epub or pdf version and search the text. It is available at https://1disease-1cure.com/.

However, for readers who wish to study this book's sources directly, I offer an abbreviated list of resources upon which _The Deepest Revolution_ is based.

The following resources were either written by people of healthy cultures or were based off of extensive, respectful interviews and observations with them. The healthy culture's name is included, based on how the author or interviewee referred to their own people.

* Charles Alexander Eastman/Ohiyesa: _The Soul of the Indian_, _From the Deep Woods to Civilization_, _Indian Child Life_, _Indian Heroes and Great Chieftains_, _Indian Boyhood_, Sioux

* John Neihardt: _Black Elk Speaks_, Lakota

* Mart√≠n Prechtel: _Secrets of the Talking Jaguar_, Tzutujil Maya

* Anne Cameron: _Daughters of Copper Woman_, Nootka

* Melissa Nelson (editor): _Original Instructions_, Haudenosaunee, Okanaga, and other healthy cultures

* George Grinnell: _When Buffalo Ran_, the healthy culture was unnamed, but likely Cheyenne

* Jean Liedloff: _Continuum Concept_, Yequana

* Robin Kimmerer: _Braiding Sweetgrass_, Potawatomi

* SM Barrett: _Geronimo's Story of His Life_, Apache

* Frank Linderman: _Pretty Shield_, Crow

* Various writers, https://enlacezapatista.ezln.org.mx/, Zapatistas

* Author interview with Nancy Basket, Cherokee

* Akwesasne Notes, a Mohawk organization: _A Basic Call to Consciousness_, Haudenosaunee. In _The Deepest Revolution_, I refer to the authors as "Haudenosaunee writers" for simplicity because the Mohawk are a nation of the Haudensaunee Confederacy, and their book discusses the Haudenosaunee as a whole.

May the wisdom of healthy cultures keep spreading and lead to many Deep Revolutions.
