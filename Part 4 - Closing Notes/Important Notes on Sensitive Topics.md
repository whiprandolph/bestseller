# Important Notes on Sensitive Topics

#### Capitalization of People's Titles

I chose not to capitalize anybody's title in this book, including president, chief, king, or doctor. Healthy nations maintain a baseline of mutual respect for everyone, and they consistently describe the importance of keeping everyone on the same level. For example, the San remind their hunters of how much they depend on their neighbors, and not to feel superior.[xxx-original instructions|peace technologies from the san bushmen of africa] Tzutujil Mayans expected new chiefs to give away all their things so everyone was on the same economic level.[xxx-secrets of the talking jaguar|p209]

Making titles lowercase reminded me that no one's title makes them special. And people without titles are no less worthy of respect.

#### On Sharing Others' Stories

If someone published their stories in a book available to the public, I chose to include some of the stories here with attribution and a respectful retelling. Whenever I privately received a story or perspective about healthy nations, I asked permission to share and for feedback to ensure it was presented as intended.

I did my best to quote or summarize all stories and cultural practices correctly, and distinguish between my own beliefs and those of others. I accept responsibility for any mistakes or misinterpretations I may have made.

#### On Healthy Nations' Names

This book uses widely recognized English names of healthy nations to make it accessible to a wide audience, and with that limitation, it uses the names that authors or speakers used to refer to themselves. For example, Ohiyesa commonly referred to himself and his people as the Sioux in his books, while Black Elk referred to his people as the Lakota. Thus when this book references stories or quotes from Ohiyesa the book refers to the Sioux, and when the book cites Black Elk it refers to the Lakota.

#### On Healthy Nations Past and Present

In order to contrast healthy and unhealthy nations, I sought out stories from when each healthy nation could fully embrace their traditional practices and way of life. Many healthy nations have been unable to live in a traditional way since unhealthy nations imposed their laws and various forms of oppression.

Okanagan Jeannette Armstrong described this when she said, "I'm not saying that [the Traditional Okanagan decision-making process is] there today, that it works today, but elements of it are still present and have been carried forward because we are only two generations since colonization began."[xxx-original instructions|armstrong]

This book refers to many traditional practices that were fully observed in the past and uses the past tense to describe these, especially when a speaker like Pretty Shield (Crow) or Black Elk (Lakota) spoke about them in the past tense. However, these nations continue to exist and embrace attitudes and practices from which others can learn a great deal.

#### Acknowledging Contradictions

This book makes the case that healthy nations are able to maintain a basically respectful way of life. However, I did find seeming contradictions in my research. For example, Prechtel described how the Tzutujil Mayans had "lords" and "ladies",[xxx-secrets of the talking jaguar|p111] a Nootka storyteller referenced royalty and slavery,[xxx-daughters of copper woman|p11] and American John Adams described the Haudenosaunee as having a "king" and "nobles."[xxx-american indian constitutions and their influence on the united states constitution]

Seeming contradictions can occur for many reasons. Often they are a simple misunderstanding: John Adams assumed every nation had rulers so he assumed the Haudenosaunee did too, but he was wrong. Sometimes words mean different things to different people, and clearly Tzutujil Mayan lords and ladies didn't have wealth or power over others the way they do in European countries.[xxx-secrets of the talking jaguar|p209] Also, not every North or South American nation was healthy just prior to Europeans' arrival. It takes judgment to choose which lessons to learn from which nations in which time period. The book _One Disease One Cure_ offers a more in-depth review of contradictions.
