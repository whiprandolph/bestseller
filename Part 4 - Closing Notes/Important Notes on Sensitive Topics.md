# Important Notes on Sensitive Topics

#### Capitalization of People's Titles

I chose not to capitalize anybody's title in this book, including president, chief, king, doctor, or anything else. Healthy nations maintain a baseline of mutual respect for everyone, and they consistently describe the importance of keeping everyone on the same level. For example, the San remind their hunters of how much they depend on their neighbors, and not to feel superior.[xxx-original instructions|peace technologies from the san bushmen of africa] Tzutujil Mayans expected new chiefs to ritually give away all their things so they were on the same economic level as everyone else.[xxx-secrets of the talking jaguar|p209]

Every human is divine, and no one is inherently more worthy of respect than anyone else. Making people's titles lowercase helped remind me that no one's title makes them special. And people without titles are not less worthy of respect.

#### On Sharing Others' Stories

I gave a lot of thought to how best to honor the stories I share in this book, and how best to honor the people to whom these stories belong.

I decided that if someone had published their stories in a book available to the public, I would include some of the stories here with attribution and a respectful retelling. Whenever I directly received a story or perspective about healthy nations in private, I asked permission to share and invited the speaker to give me feedback on the final presentation to ensure the story or perspective was presented as they intended.

I did my best to quote or summarize all stories and cultural practices correctly, and distinguish between my own beliefs and those of others. I accept responsibility for any mistakes or misinterpretations I may have made.

#### On Healthy Nations' Names

I have chosen to use widely recognized English names of healthy nations to make this book accessible to a wide audience, and with that limitation, I generally use the names that authors or speakers used to refer to themselves. For example, Ohiyesa commonly referred to himself and his people as the Sioux in his books, while Black Elk referred to his people as the Lakota. Thus when this book references stories or quotes from Ohiyesa the book refers to the Sioux, and when the book cites Black Elk it refers to the Lakota.

#### On Healthy Nations Past and Present

One way that unhealthy nations minimize or dismiss healthy nations is by propagating the incorrect belief that they all died out long ago.

This is not true. Millions of people around the world either live in fully sovereign healthy nations or remember ancestors who lived in a good way and maintain much of their healthy nations' wisdom and practices. This book references the recent history of healthy nations, such as the Lakota and Nootka, including their environmental activism as well as how their children were forced into abusive schools.

In order to contrast unhealthy nations and healthy nations, I sought out stories from when each healthy nation could fully embrace their traditional practices and way of life.

The Ashaninka continue to live in a traditional way today while many nations, such as the Okanaga and Cherokee, have been unable to fully embrace their traditional ways of life since the unhealthy nations imposed their laws and various forms of oppression. The same is true for many other healthy nations around the world.

In this book, I refer to many traditional practices that were fully observed in the past, and I use the past tense to describe these, especially when a speaker like the Crow woman Pretty Shield, Okanagan Jeannette Armstrong, or Lakota man Black Elk spoke about them in the past tense. I also acknowledge that many of these nations continue to exist and embrace attitudes and practices from which people in unhealthy nations can learn a great deal.

Okanagan Jeannette Armstrong described this when she said, "I'm not saying that [the Traditional Okanagan decision-making process is] there today, that it works today, but elements of it are still present and have been carried forward because we are only two generations since colonization began."[xxx-original instructions|armstrong]
