# Important Notes on Sensitive Topics

#### Capitalization of People's Titles

I chose not to capitalize anybody's title in this book, including president, chief, king, doctor, or anything else. Healthy cultures maintain a baseline of mutual respect for everyone, and they consistently describe the importance of keeping everyone on the same level. For example, the San remind their hunters of how much they depend on their neighbors, and not to feel superior.[xxx-original instructions|peace technologies from the san bushmen of africa] Tzutujil Mayans expected new chiefs to ritually give away all their things so they were on the same economic level as everyone else.[xxx-secrets of the talking jaguar|p209]

Every human is divine, and no one is inherently more worthy of respect than anyone else. Making people's titles lowercase helped remind me that no one's title makes them special. And people without titles are not less worthy of respect.

#### On Sharing Others' Stories

I gave a lot of thought to how best to honor the stories I share in this book, and how best to honor the people to whom these stories belong. I tried to reach out to some people of healthy cultures with mixed results. I'm grateful for the interviews I received, but sometimes I was not able to make contact, and I had to decide whether I would use stories from cultures I could not contact directly.

I decided that if someone had published their stories in a book available to the public, I would include some of the stories here with attribution and a respectful retelling. Whenever I directly received a story or perspective about healthy cultures in private, I asked permission to share and invited the speaker to give me feedback on the final presentation to ensure the story or perspective was presented as they intended.

I did my best to quote or summarize all stories and cultural practices correctly, and distinguish between my own beliefs and those of others. I accept responsibility for any mistakes or misinterpretations I may have made.

#### On Healthy Culture Names

European racism and misunderstandings about healthy cultures has been so intense that even English names for healthy cultures have sometimes had negative implications. 

For example, the people who call themselves "Lakota" or "Dakota" were never collectively called the "Sioux" until Europeans arrived. Lakota and Dakota refer to distinct groups presently united in the Lakota Dakota Nakota Traditional and Spiritual Government.[xxx-sioux or lakota] It is not certain where the word Sioux came from, but one story is that European colonists asked the Ojibway people about them and heard the term "Nadouwesou," which they shortened to Sioux. However, in the Ojibway language, that word means "little snakes."[xxx-sitting bull sioux]

I have chosen to use widely recognized English names of healthy cultures to make the book accessible to a wide audience, and with that limitation, I generally use the names that authors or speakers used to refer to themselves. For example, Ohiyesa commonly referred to himself and his people as the Sioux in his books, while Black Elk referred to his people as the Lakota. Thus when this book references stories or quotes from Ohiyesa the book refers to the Sioux, and when the book cites Black Elk it refers to the Lakota.

#### On Healthy Cultures Past and Present

One way that unhealthy cultures minimize or dismiss healthy cultures is by propagating the incorrect belief that they all died out long ago.

This is not true. Millions of people around the world either live in fully sovereign healthy cultures or remember ancestors who lived in a good way and maintain much of their healthy cultures' wisdom and practices. This book references the recent history of healthy cultures, such as the Lakota and Nootka, including their environmental activism as well as how their children were forced into abusive schools.

In order to contrast unhealthy cultures and healthy cultures, I sought out stories from when each healthy culture could fully embrace their traditional practices and way of life.

The Ashaninka continue to live in a traditional way today while many cultures, such as the Okanaga and Cherokee, have been unable to fully embrace their traditional ways of life since the unhealthy cultures imposed their laws and various forms of oppression. The same is true for many other healthy cultures around the world.

In this book, I refer to many traditional practices that were fully observed in the past, and I use the past tense to describe these, especially when a speaker like the Crow woman Pretty Shield, Okanagan Jeannette Armstrong, or Lakota man Black Elk spoke about them in the past tense. I also acknowledge that many of these cultures continue to exist and embrace attitudes and practices from which people in unhealthy cultures can learn a great deal.

Okanagan Jeannette Armstrong described this when she said, "I'm not saying that [the Traditional Okanagan decision-making process is] there today, that it works today, but elements of it are still present and have been carried forward because we are only two generations since colonization began."[xxx-original instructions|armstrong]

Unhealthy cultures encourage forgetting, which is why so many people have forgotten that their ancestors lived in healthy cultures. This book acknowledges traditional practices from the past and present, the efforts of many brave people to preserve ancient wisdom and practices for the future, and the present-day gifts of healthy cultures.

#### Preface to Chapters Containing the Word "Nigger" (Audio Version Only)

In this chapter, I quote people who use the term "nigger," a word closely associated with centuries of racist abuse. I believe strongly in telling stories as they happened and quoting what people truly said. In this audio book, I have decided to convey these racially sensitive quotes accurately.
