I've never been part of a deep revolution, but I've found stories of people who have. where people created new healthy cultures in the midst of violence so they could live in a good way again.

Pull from Basic Call to Consciousness / Chap 31 and Zapatistas / Chap 40.

Practical, Aware Gratitude:
* awareness
* receiving the gifts of the Earth: food, medicine, shelter, life lessons

Giving my Sacred Gifts
* integrity/authenticity/joy/etc - sacred urges

integrity
avoiding assumptions
deep awareness (from racism/unity chapter)
bravery
generosity
reciprocity
giving sacred gifts
gratitude
account for the nonhumans' needs
    * okanagan enowkwinwix (sp?)
initiative

* All these are actually different facets of an integrated person. Bravery and integrity aren't different. Bravery is a person's willingness to show up with integrity no matter what. 


we have a way of life that results in all these things - results in the death of our spiritual leaders, results in racism and greed and pollution and corruption. We've been trained by ruling classes across centuries to tolerate having rulers. Of course we will need courage to cultivate a different way of life - new in some ways, ancient in other ways.

What is purpose of the book?

## Cultivating Bravery with Others
* each person must be held to a high standard _on their own terms_. Meaning:

1. Ask them what their goals are. If you suspect they're dreaming small and choosing too-easy goals, share your concerns and ask them to either assuage your doubts or choose better goals that will really lead to personal growth.

2. Ask what standards they want to be held to. Do not hold them to your standards, which may be different. If you think they're choosing weak standards, share your concerns as in step 1.

I have struggled to begin successful accountability groups because people were afraid of being judged by others' standards instead of their own. For example, I once invited a homosexual friend to be part of a men's group once, and he liked the format and valued personal growth, but worried about being the only homosexual man and didn't want ignorant heterosexual men holding him to standards that didn't make sense, or might even be offensive.

So, again, the group should ask each individual what their goals and standards are, and then help hold them accountable.

## Stay Present With the Discomfort

* these exercises only help if you stay present with the discomfort - if you ignore how cold you feel, you'll only slightly increase your cold tolerance and won't get more brave. If you feel the cold and practice relaxing into it, and even getting excited about it, then your cold tolerance will grow more rapidly as will your bravery.
