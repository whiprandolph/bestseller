## Integrity and Bravery

If you wanted to be part of a society where you totally trusted everyone else in every way, and you wanted them to trust you just as much, what qualities would you need to cultivate to make that possible?

Most people know the importance of honesty and promise-keeping, two forms of integrity. I want to trust people to tell me the truth, no matter how unpleasant, so I value honesty. I want to be able to rely on people, so I value relationships with people who keep their promises.

There's another way that I believe all people want to trust: that people will "do what's right" or "do the right thing" even if they haven't explicitly promised to. In other words, people want to trust that others in their society will act in service of their neighbors instead of selfishly, even if they haven't made any specific promises.

This trust is easy to see. Every infant is born trusting their mother to care for them, without the mother ever making any promises. When I go to the doctor, I trust that the doctor will try to heal me instead of maximizing their pay. Children at school trust the teacher to support their personal growth first, not prioritize their career or pay. This attitude of service is assumed -- how offended would a doctor or teacher be if patients or students asked them to explicitly promise not to be corrupt and prioritize their own career over healing or teaching? And of course, the newborn couldn't even ask for a promise -- they have no choice but to trust.

I don't expect any random doctor to heal me or teacher to teach me. But once I enter into a doctor-patient relationship, or a teacher-student relationship, and I've paid any needed fees, I have this expectation that they'll act in service of me. A mother creates this trust-relationship by giving birth.

I believe in a deep way, everybody wants to trust that others in their society will act in service of the group rather than selfishly, so I consider acting in service its own kind of integrity -- what I call "integrity of service." 

### Integrity as Structure of People, Societies

The word "integrity" is widely associated with strength or firmness in many fields. One engineering company defines _structural integrity_ as "the ability of a structure to withstand its intended load without experiencing failure."[xxx-arch struxure integrity] When a bridge or building "loses integrity," this means it is close to collapse.

Researchers also describe integrity as part of a person's emotional strength. One psychiatrist defines integrity as "maintaining an integrated, whole self -- bringing oneself 'wholeheartedly' to a situation."[xxx-psych today 4 ways cultivate integrity] Other researchers have illustrated how a person's integrity allows them to maintain a "solid sense of self and emotional balance."[xxx-psych today integral role integrity] Thus a person without integrity is somehow not integrated or whole, or somehow not solid or balanced.

Whether in engineering, psychology, or many other settings, integrity is commonly recognized as the essence of something's structure. Anything without integrity is unreliable, prone to collapse, or not solid. I believe the same is true for healthy cultures.

Just as a bridge requires structural integrity to remain strong, and individuals require integrity to remain integrated and whole, human cultures require integrity to remain healthy.

People can agree to protect each other from attack, share resources, or agree to live respectfully together, but will they actually keep their agreements? Integrity allows people to uphold important agreements, and thus I believe integrity forms the structure of any healthy culture. Can I rely on my neighbors to support me if enemies approach? If one neighbor acts disrespectfully, can I rely on the rest of my neighbors to stand in solidarity with me, and ensure that everyone enjoys a baseline of mutual respect?

This all comes down to integrity. Do people consistently speak the truth and keep their promises, even when it might be uncomfortable or dangerous? If not, then I cannot trust my neighbors, and I'm on my own. When people consistently show integrity, then everybody can relax into a deep trust of each other. We know that we can rely on each other no matter what comes, and this is part of what it means to live in a healthy culture.

Unhealthy cultures don't train people to have deep integrity. In fact, some kinds of integrity are forbidden. When someone behaves inappropriately, authorities may or may not order the police to take care of it, and everyone else is forbidden from responding. After all, only the police are allowed to enforce the law. No one else is allowed to hold people accountable for inappropriate behavior or uphold the rules of their unhealthy culture.

In a culture without authorities imposing law and enforcing it, how would people protect each other, take care of each other, and stand for a culture of mutual respect? I believe it comes down to integrity: people simply make agreements for how they will live together, and they hold each other to a high standard of integrity to ensure everybody upholds those agreements.

And because it's impossible to make agreements to cover every possible scenario, I believe healthy cultures all encourage integrity of service -- that willingness to "do the right thing" even without explicitly promising. I believe this is what allows people to have that deep trust that, no matter what challenges arise, they can trust their neighbors to show up in a good way.

### Bravery: the Capacity to Act with Integrity of Service in any Situation

For years I thought of bravery as the ability to aggressively face danger without fear.

Finally I found a deeper perspective on bravery offered by the Sioux man Ohiyesa:

> [An Indian's] own conception of bravery makes of it a high moral virtue, for to him it consists not so much in aggressive self-assertion as in absolute self-control. The truly brave man, we contend, yields neither to fear nor anger, desire nor agony; he is at all times master of himself; his courage rises to the heights of chivalry, patriotism, and real heroism.

I think of bravery this way: I think of bravery this way: _A person showing bravery remains fully conscious and acts in service of what matters under any challenge._

In other words, bravery is simply a person's ability to have that integrity of service no matter what. That is, they'll "do the right thing" or "do what's right" even if it's scary, uncomfortable, or stressful.

If people only stood in solidarity when it felt good, solidarity would not be worth much! It's people's willingness to stand in solidarity or act with integrity even when it feels difficult that gives relationships strength. It's also what allows people to deeply trust each other.

### Bravery can be Practiced

I have good news: like authenticity, gratitude, and many other qualities, bravery can be practiced.

In a really scary or uncomfortable situation, an untrained person can feel overwhelmed and their consciousness becomes clouded. Such a person may act selfishly or hurtfully, not out of clear, calm decision-making, but out of an untrained, instinctual response to overwhelming feelings.

Thus a major aspect of training bravery is to train myself not to feel overwhelmed when I'm scared or uncomfortable. I practice remaining conscious and clear-minded even in very scary or uncomfortable moments. I call this _feeling comfortable in the midst of discomfort_.

The best way to practice remaining conscious when I feel afraid or uncomfortable is to intentionally put myself in situations in which I feel afraid or uncomfortable, and practice remaining conscious. In other words, I intentionally cause myself to feel fear or discomfort so that I can practice relating to them in a good way.

A beautiful example comes from the mother of Sioux man Little Crow. She was a chief's daughter and widely recognized for her spirit and beauty. Shortly after Little Crow was born, she would take him to an ice covered lake, find a hole in the ice, and plunge her baby into the water. Then she would rub him with snow afterwards to strengthen his nerves. However, Little Crow remained completely safe in his loving mother's arms. Thus Little Crow learned to associate a sense of safety and comfort with the discomfort of severe freezing cold. She also took him out into the deep woods for days at a time so that he would feel comfortable with solitude and not fear being alone in the wilderness. At a young age, she threw a feast for Little Crow and announced that he would fast for two days. She did these things because she wanted him to be a worthy leader of his people.

She said, "My son, if you are to be a leader of men, you must listen in silence to the mystery, the spirit."

I have found cold-training very helpful, and I recommend Wim Hof's cold training program, where participants take on a slightly bigger cold challenge each week. Participants start with a warm shower followed by a 30-second cold shower each day for the first week. For each day in the second week, participants take a 30-second cold shower, a normal warm shower, and then a 30-second cold shower. Each following week becomes a little harder. Eventually I was taking 20 minute long ice baths and stayed comfortably in near-freezing ocean water for 90 minutes while harvesting seaweed.

This careful progression is essential. Consistently facing one's edge or one's fears helps cultivate bravery, as well as whatever other skill is being practiced. Increasing difficulty too fast could cause injury or demotivation, and too little difficulty does not improve bravery or the other skills.

### What Makes a Healthy Culture?

Let's imagine a scenario where a group of bullies is picking on younger kids at school, teasing them, taking their money, and sometimes hitting them.

Suppose some of these younger kids don't want to tolerate this abusive behavior anymore, and they discuss what to do. They want to set healthy boundaries, where disrespectful behavior is not allowed towards anyone in their group. How could they do this?

First, they would _set agreements_. How does each child agree to respond when they see someone in their group being bullied? They have many options here -- perhaps they could all walk over and stand with the kid being bullied and collectively tell the older kids to back off. Perhaps one of them could document the bullying on video so that adults could intervene. Whatever the kids decide, they must somehow agree to support each other so that collectively they don't allow any disrespect towards anyone in the group.

The second requirement is that the kids have _integrity_. They have to keep their agreements. Without agreements, the kids won't know how they can rely on each other for support. And if they don't have integrity, and they shy away from the bullies out of fear, then the agreements are worthless. Thus the kids must hold each other to a high standard of integrity to collectively protect themselves from bullying.

* Boundaries = agreements + integrity

* External boundaries, internal boundaries, the how to live within those boundaries, accounting for the people's and Earth's needs.

* Every healthy culture also takes the Earth's needs into account as a normal way of life.
