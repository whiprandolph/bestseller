## Chapter 4: What If Pervasive Generosity Was Normal?

Take a moment and picture living in a world where people routinely look out for the health and safety of each other. A nation of neighbors who ensure each person -- young or old -- has food to eat, tools to share, and a place to sleep. Imagine the feeling of safety from knowing that you don't need to fend for yourself in times of drought, famine, or even war. A world where people take care of each other in times of trouble instead of thinking only of themselves, or trying to make a buck off of it.

Hard to imagine, isn't it?

In the United States, like every unhealthy culture, people generally have to fend for themselves. Businesses must make a profit (take in more money than they give out), or else they go under. And most workers try to make as much money as possible too.

This drive to get more than we give, or even get rich, is not our human nature. It is one of the natural consequences of living in an unhealthy culture, with an economy that rewards selfishness and threatens people with sickness, hunger, homelessness, isolation, shame, and worse if they don't make enough money.

When you live in a culture where few people care if you eat tonight or what happens to you tomorrow, the selfish desire to take as much as possible (i.e. to get rich) is naturally pervasive -- and as a result, it seems quite normal.

But is it really normal?

Every healthy culture I've studied strongly promotes generosity (giving) and reciprocity (sharing with others who share with me) as a normal way of life. The following stories show what life would be like if, instead of default selfishness, generosity and reciprocity were the norm.

### Generosity from Birth

Traditionally, Sioux parents gave many feasts to celebrate their children's developmental milestones, including their first step, first spoken word, first game killed, and so on, and at each feast the parents gave away as much as they could for the benefit of those who had little.

Sioux parents didn't just model generosity; they actively encouraged generosity in children from an early age. In one story, Red Cloud's community was going through a very hungry winter when his father finally hunted two elk. Little Red Cloud, at 4 or 5 years old, went and invited all the old people to come get food -- without his parents' permission! His mother gave away almost all their food, and when little Red Cloud said he was hungry the next day, his mother did not admonish him. Instead she encouraged him to be brave as he faced the consequences of his generosity. She said, "Remember, my son, they went home singing praises in your name, not my name or your father's. You must be brave. You must live up to your reputation."

### Generosity Towards All Life

This generosity doesn't just exist between the people in these societies. In every single beautiful culture I found, their generosity extended to the nonhumans as well. That is, the people live or lived in a way that benefits the nonhumans around them.  

Jeannette Armstrong described the traditional Okanagan decision-making process called en'owkinwiwx, and how it very carefully took into account the full range of the humans' and nonhumans' needs. She was trained as a _land speaker_, and her role in their group decision-making was to consider every decision's effects on the land. In this way, the Okanagans made sure to always take the non-humans' needs into account.

In his book _Wolf Totem_, Jiang Rong describes living with Mongolian hunter-shepherds. These people recognized that while the wolves sometimes ate the people's sheep, the wolves also ate gazelles which would overeat and destroy the grassland if the wolves didn't keep them in check. Without the grassland, the sheep would die, and humans couldn't survive either. Thus the hunter-shepherds were very careful not to overhunt the wolves, ensuring the whole ecosystem could thrive.

### Generosity is the Norm

These stories really touched me, even shocked me. But in time I realized this way of life is simply normal in any society that encourages generosity and strongly discourages selfishness. The people base their lives on the three core spiritual practices of gratitude, gift-giving, and reciprocity, and so generosity is pervasive in all these societies, including their leadership. They aren't necessarily generous to outsiders -- often they have been, and sometimes they haven't. But within the culture, they maintain generosity as a normal way of life.

I grew up in a Christian family, and I learned about Jesus Christ's extreme generosity as he gave away all his possessions and encouraged his followers to do the same. Now I know that his generosity only seemed extreme because I live in an unhealthy culture that normalizes greed (just like Rome in Jesus's time). Jesus Christ's generosity would just seem normal in healthy cultures.

Nancy Basket described one way that Cherokee women traditionally redistributed goods. In one ceremony, all the ladies would honor the oldest woman in town by bringing her gifts. They knew she didn't need all the stuff, but they trusted that she would know where the goods needed to go. This old woman would then distribute the gifts to whomever needed them the most. This is one way that the Cherokee moved things from the people who had them to the people who most needed them.

Jesuit missionaries stayed with the Montagnais-Naskapi and noticed that men left household affairs almost entirely up to the women. Regardless how much food they brought in, it never lasted long because the woman commonly shared the food with everyone. Paul Le Jeune wrote, "I have never seen my host ask a giddy young woman that he had with him what became of the provisions, although they were disappearing very fast." Generous sharing was simply the norm.

I've studied many different kinds of economies, whether communism in the Soviet Union, capitalism in the United States, or socialism in China. They may seem very different, but at their core, all these economies encourage selfishness. 

I saw the same selfishness in American employees trying to maximize their wages, business owners trying to maximize profits, or Chinese farm brigade workers in the 1950s trying to maximize their work points. One way or another, all these economies have encouraged people to try to get as much as possible, either to get rich or to avoid poverty or punishment.

How do healthy cultures ensure they avoid this sort of hurtful selfishness?

### Actively Avoiding Selfishness at All Costs

How do healthy cultures maintain widespread generosity? Is it by chance? Are some societies just lucky, and others aren't?

Eventually I noticed that it's no accident: in every healthy culture I've found, people recognize that selfishness would be a tremendous threat if it were ever allowed to take hold, and they go to great lengths to help everyone feel comfortable with sharing generously.

Robin Kimmerer described how the traditional Potawatomi noticed when people behaved selfishly and helped them feel comfortable sharing again. If someone refused to share, the Potawatomi first counseled them, and if they insisted on acting greedily, they then escalated to ostracizing and even banishing them.

Kimmerer wrote, "It is a terrible punishment to be banished from the web of reciprocity, with no one to share with you and no one for you to care for." They set a strong energetic boundary, not allowing selfishness to take hold in their culture. After all, if some individuals began acting selfishly, others might feel the need to act selfishly to protect themselves, and soon selfishness might become pervasive in the society. And who would want to be in a culture with pervasive selfishness and greed? 

The traditional Haudenosaunee were likewise very aware of how terrible life would be if selfishness were allowed to take hold in their culture. They rejected systems of private property, and some Haudenosaunee wrote, "That idea (property) would produce slavery." They even knew what kind of leaders would be chosen in any society that embraced private property and selfishness: "The acceptance of the idea of property would produce leaders whose functions would favor excluding people from access to property, and they would cease to perform their functions as leaders of our societies and distributors of goods."

In other words, in healthy cultures, it's no accident that they maintain a way of life based on generosity and mutual respect. In every healthy culture I've found, they recognize the profound threat that selfish behavior represents, and they go to great lengths to avoid it.

Jeannette Armstrong's description of Okanagan decision-making shows how beautiful life can be in cultures that embrace generosity and reciprocity, and why people would go to such great lengths to avoid selfishness. When a community includes the perspectives of human relationships and the land in their decision-making, "community changes... the material things don't have a lot of meaning... material wealth and the securing of it or being fearful and being frightened about not having 'things' to sustain you, disappears... The realization that people and community are there to sustain you creates the most secure feeling in the world... When that happens, you're imbued with the hope that others surrounding you in your community can provide."

### Why Doesn't Everybody Live Like This?

For years, I wondered what all these beautiful cultures have in common. In traditional stories from all these healthy cultures, just like I had seen with the Ashaninka, they seem to avoid crime without having any police or prisons. Integrity and generosity are pervasive, and they have leaders that people actually want to follow. It's normal for people to accept deep responsibility to treat each other and the Earth in a good way. Why do some cultures have these qualities, and others seem really unhealthy?

And what do all these unhealthy cultures have in common, with their racism, sexism, self-serving political leaders, pollution, and more?

Do cultures become unhealthy when the population gets too large? Some academic literature states that humans can only maintain tight knit communities of up to 150 people, a limit called "Dunbar's number." I commonly hear people claim that humans start behaving inappropriately towards each other in groups larger than 150, as accountability mechanisms supposedly start to break down then.

But that doesn't make sense. The Ashaninka number more than 2,000 and maintain a generous, relaxed culture where everyone is treated respectfully.

The Cherokee in 1674 CE numbered approximately 50,000 and likewise maintained that internal baseline of mutual respect amongst themselves.

Do cultures become unhealthy when they cover too much area? That doesn't make sense either. As of the early 1700s, the Haudenosaunee Confederacy covered over 38,000 square miles. This is comparable in size to Switzerland, Bhutan, or Taiwan. If the Haudenosaunee were a US state, it would be the 38th largest, between Kentucky and Indiana.

Before extended European contact, the Cherokee covered approximately 40,000 sq miles. Clearly humans can maintain healthy cultures that cover huge distances and include many thousands of people.

Did the trouble happen when people started farming? No, the Huron gained about 75% of the food they ate from crops they grew. They still shocked French missionaries who couldn't understand how people could get along without police, prisons, and authorities imposing law and order. Even prior to contact with European colonizers, the Haudenosaunee relied more on farming than hunting for food.

Sometimes people of these cultures are called native, indigenous, tribal, indian, or first nations. I call them healthy human cultures!

I have found one root difference between healthy and unhealthy human cultures:

<center>__*In healthy cultures, everyone stands for a culture of mutual respect, and nobody rules over anybody else.*__</center>

In healthy cultures, everyone is expected to _uphold_ their law. In unhealthy cultures, people are expected to _obey_ the laws they're given, but they're punished for upholding the law themselves -- after all, that is the police's job, though the police have to follow orders too.

In healthy cultures, everyone stands for a culture of mutual respect, so they have strong leaders and no rulers and nobody imposes law on anybody else. Everyone agrees on their rules for appropriate behavior, and so they can live in a respectful way with each other and the Earth. And when someone behaves inappropriately, anyone may take initiative to ensure that the misbehaving person is held accountable. Such healthy cultures may fight with each other, but within the culture, they maintain a baseline of mutual respect.

In unhealthy human cultures, one person or a few people rule over everyone else. Whether the rulers are kings, billionaires, imams, priests, prime ministers, or presidents, they impose laws that everyone else must follow or face severe punishment. The rulers choose how to enforce the law, and forbid everybody else from taking initiative to hold misbehaving people accountable.

Another way of putting it is this: in unhealthy cultures, a small number of people trap a large number in exploitative relationships. Rulers use all manner of tricks, traps, and childhood training to convince everyone to remain obedient. Many of these abusive techniques are reviewed briefly in this book, and they are covered in greater detail in the free book _One Disease One Cure_ by the same author.

Other names for an unhealthy culture include "authoritarian culture," "unfree culture," "low-accountability culture" and "abusive culture."

Having rulers creates all the other problems that anybody can see. Racism, sexism, dishonest leadership, pollution, disconnection from nature, selfishness, widespread child abuse, and poverty are all merely _common symptoms caused by the root cultural disease where some people rule over everyone else, and forbid people from upholding their own laws_.

Every single culture where a person or group imposes law on the rest also has sexism, racism, greed, corruption, poverty, and so many other troubles that seem to never go away.

I simply don't see these troubles in societies where everyone stands for what's right, and everyone agrees on the rules they will live by -- that is, in cultures without a ruling class imposing laws on the rest.

That is good news! It means there is a way to end racism. There is also a way to end sexism, widespread greed, pollution, disconnection from nature, and so many other problems. The way to end all these troubles is simply the path to freedom: working with other people to generate a culture where everyone agrees on their laws and everyone bravely upholds them as a normal way of life, taking humans' and nonhumans' needs into account.

How do rulers or ruling classes make it so hard to have an economy based on sharing and reciprocity? And how do ruling classes shape their society so people tolerate endless exploitation and corruption?
