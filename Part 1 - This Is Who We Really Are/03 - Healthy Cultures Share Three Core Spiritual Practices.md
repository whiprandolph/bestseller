## Chapter 3: Healthy Cultures Share Three Core Spiritual Practices

I kept finding more stories of cultures that reminded me of the Ashaninka, such as the Yequana, Apache, Haudenosaunee, Lakota, and others. Not all these cultures can live in a traditional way today like the Ashaninka. While these cultures have their differences, during traditional times they all live or lived in a similarly beautiful way with each other and the Earth.

Eventually I heard about a self-study program called Kamana (now called _Living Connection 1st_). The program promised to help people connect with the Earth using similar practices, stories, and attitudes as in many of the cultures I was reading about. The lead author, Jon Young, had received mentorship and guidance from sub-chief Jake Swamp of the Mohawks within the Haudenosaunee Confederacy, Ingwe who was raised by the Akamba people in Kenya, Gilbert Walking Bull and Tony Ten Fingers of the Lakota, and Tom Brown Jr who'd received extensive training from Stalking Wolf, an Apache man.

The Kamana program seemed like a synthesis of what Jon Young had learned from people of all these cultures with the goal for the student to develop a deep, personal connection with the Earth.

Little did I know that Kamana would introduce me to spiritual practices which are common in all healthy cultures. I believe that many of the other shared characteristics of healthy cultures, past and present, flow from this spiritual foundation.

### The First Core Spiritual Practice: A Practical, Aware Gratitude

I learned directly about the first spiritual practice of _cultivating a practical, aware gratitude_ for the gifts of life by repeatedly immersing myself in the natural world. I went to the same place every day, sitting in the same spot, and focused my attention on observing the nonhumans all around me. At first, I felt a bit bored. But the more I observed the world around me, the more I began to see.

Over time, I learned to notice which plants are edible, and which trees offer good wood for burning. I studied the language of birds, and what they could tell me about the rest of the forest.

The more I learned how every creature and plant contributes to the web of life, the more grateful I felt. Some trees are especially good at holding the soil in place on the edge of a stream -- holding the soil down is a gift they give. Birds' songs can alert me to nearby animals that I cannot see myself. Animals give the gifts of meat for food and hides for clothing. Streams give water for drinking. The sun gives us all warmth and light.

All these things are gifts! No one makes the trees offer their gifts of shade or firewood. I can plant an apple tree and tend it, but I cannot make it bear fruit -- that is its gift.

The first core spiritual practice is to notice all the gifts we receive and feel grateful for them. Every healthy culture has its own ways of expressing gratitude, but they all have _some_ way.

The Haudenosaunee have their beautiful Thanksgiving Address, where they methodically name many kinds of life and give thanks for the gifts of each one.[xxx-kamana 2 nat|p1] Okanagan woman Jeannette Armstrong described how they love other species as brothers and sisters.[xxx-original instructions|armstrong] Potawatomi woman Robin Kimmerer described how humans are the "younger brothers of Creation" and our older nonhuman siblings can teach many gifts of wisdom.[xxx-braiding sweetgrass|skywoman falling]

I grew up learning to give thanks to God by closing my eyes and trying to ignore my surroundings so I could focus on the prayer. I prayed by thinking thoughts in my head, directed to my idea or feeling of God. And I thanked my mental idea of God for all the good things in my life.

Instead of closing my senses and thinking a prayer to my idea of God, I practiced keeping all my senses wide open and giving thanks to all the beings directly for their gifts. Instead of just having the feeling of gratitude or giving thanks vaguely, I practiced noticing the practical ways each being helped me or contributed to the web of life all around -- by teaching me something, feeding me or other animals, shading the soil so it would stay moist, and more. Paying attention and noticing all the gifts I received was the path to cultivating _a practical, aware gratitude_ for the gifts of life.

Once I started seeing nonhumans as teachers and feeling grateful for them, I started learning lessons too. I'll never forget my first clear lesson from a nonhuman, a hunting lesson from red-shouldered hawks. I was walking through a forest and observed a single hawk flying and screeching overhead. Red-shouldered hawks like to hunt small animals like mice and shrews, so I knew they all would be acutely aware of the predator flying above. I assumed the hawk wasn't interested in hunting, since otherwise, why make so much noise?

I looked up through the forest canopy just in time to notice a second, silent hawk flying to the first one. Once they were together, the loud hawk flew in one direction screeching, and the silent hawk flew in the opposite direction. If I were a little mouse, I might feel relief at hearing the loud hawk fly away, and if I relaxed my guard I might not notice the silent hawk flying right over me! The hawks taught me a way to use deception while hunting. They also taught me to question my assumptions.

<div class="rev-act"><div class="rev-act-header">Revolutionary Activity #3<br/>Gratitude for the nonhumans' gifts</div>
<div class="rev-act-body">Cultivating a practical, aware gratitude begins with noticing the gifts you receive. To start, go outside and find a nonhuman to observe closely, and ask what its gifts are.<br/><br/>For example, if you observed a tree, you would ask: how does the tree benefit all the life around it, including you? One way to find out is to ask "what would be different if the tree weren't there?" Does the tree provide nest sites for birds? Does it give you privacy or provide beautiful greenery? Does it hold the soil in place to prevent erosion? Notice every gift that you can, and practice feeling grateful for them.</div></div>

### The Second Core Spiritual Practice: Giving My Sacred Gifts

Through my nature connection practices, I learned so many ways each creature contributes to the web of life, but I had never wondered what _my_ contribution could be. No one had ever told me this before, but I learned that each human also has sacred gifts to give -- just like all the animals and plants. It only makes sense, since we humans are divine creatures like everything else in Creation.

Once again, every single healthy culture I studied recognized this to be true. Tony Ten Fingers described a Lakota phrase, "mitakuye oyasin," loosely meaning "everything is my relative." Ten Fingers' elders also taught him a deeper meaning: "I have a burning desire in my heart to know how I fit into the Creation which is one living being."[xxx-kamana 3 nat|burning desire heart]

Nancy Basket described the traditional Cherokee understanding: "Each lifetime you come with a medicine, a purpose that only you can get done. If you don't get it done, it won't get done. That's how important each person is. What is it that you love to do?"[xxx-basket interview]

Just like everybody else, you have sacred gifts, a life purpose, a way you can make the world a better place -- _and only you can do it!_ All of Creation is simply divine creatures giving their sacred gifts. Thus the second core spiritual practice is to _cultivate and give your sacred gifts_ too.

I believe that cultivating and giving one's sacred gifts fully is how a person gives their deepest love. Thus, training a person to give their sacred gifts trains them to give their deepest love in life, and to be their best self.

Some people have a special calling to enrich the soil, find food during lean times, or mentor children. Others are fighters who protect their people, or mediators who resolve conflict, or historians who keep ancient stories alive. I learned that it's up to each of us to find our sacred gift or gifts and our own unique way of making the world a better place. Ten Fingers also noted that it's each of our responsibility to help each other find their gifts, since sometimes a person can struggle to discover them on their own.

Like the Thanksgiving Address and cultivating a practical, aware gratitude, I had a hard time with this practice too. I had never thought about my life purpose or what I deeply loved to do. Mostly I'd focused on building a safe and comfortable life, and I'd never thought about what I would do or give if I didn't feel constrained by needing a job. When I thought about it, I mostly felt stressed or anxious.

I knew I had a passion for learning and teaching self-defense even though I hadn't practiced in years. While continuing with the nature connection training, I enrolled in jiu jitsu martial arts classes. I was suddenly walking a more meaningful path, and I felt better.

These two spiritual practices of gratitude and gift-giving are both so beautiful. The third core spiritual practice ties them all together.

### The Third Core Spiritual Practice: Living in Reciprocity

Healthy cultures like the Ashaninka, Cherokee, and Potawatomi remain alive around the world, even if many are not able to fully live in their traditional ways. One day I noticed something interesting: they keep showing up in the news. Often when some environmental catastrophe occurs or a selfish corporation threatens to pollute the Earth, I notice people of healthy cultures standing in solidarity with the land.

The Sioux led the Dakota Access Pipeline protests in 2016 in North America, seeking to protect the water from oil spills.[xxx-cultural survival standing rock] In 2010, the Indian government evicted many Jenu Kuruba people from their ancestral land, supposedly to protect local populations of endangered tigers. The Jenu Kuruba noted that the tiger population was so high where they lived precisely because they worship the tigers, as well as the other nonhumans. "To worship" means the same as "to respect," so the Jenu Kuruba simply live in a way that respects the tigers and takes their needs into account.[xxx-basket interview] The Jenu Kuruba demanded to be allowed to return and that the Indian government stop giving mining companies leases on their homeland.[xxx-cnapa concept note]<sup>,</sup>[xxx-the best guardians of the forest]

In Africa, the Mbuti likewise rejected a government so-called "conservation" effort that tried to force them off their land while companies came to dig for gold. One hunter named Mapenzi said, "We know how to protect our forest because nobody knows it the way we do. We know where the animals give birth, where they sleep and during which periods one must never kill them... The animals that the modern law wants to conserve are already under our customary protection. These are the laws our ancestors established."[xxx-guardian mbuti] The Gumbaynggirr in Australia and Sami in northern Europe work to prevent logging the old-growth forests.[xxx-australia example]<sup>,</sup>[xxx-resilience sami skerk]

In South America, the Yuracares, Tchimanes and other cultures work to prevent the destruction of their forests in the TIPNIS region of Bolivia, where the government wants to allow illegal road development, monocrop farming, and deforestation.[xxx-counterpunch tipnis] In northern Asia, the Evenk, Nivkh, and other cultures work to stop destructive Russian oil and gas extraction activities.[xxx-cultural survival sakhalin island]

Everywhere I looked, I noticed healthy cultures were standing in solidarity with the Earth, sometimes even putting their lives on the line to do so. Eventually I understood this as the third core spiritual practice: _living in reciprocity_. This means I have a responsibility to give back to all the beings who give so much to me. This is not merely a nice idea; it is a core practice for individuals and groups who take responsibility for their neighbors, both human and nonhuman.

In her book _Braiding Sweetgrass_, Robin Kimmerer noted how cultures of gratitude must incorporate reciprocity too, saying, "Each person, human or no, is bound to every other in a reciprocal relationship. Just as all beings have a duty to me, I have a duty to them." If I receive meat from an animal, I am bound to support the animal or its family. When I eat corn, I have a responsibility to take care of the soil it grows in. When I receive a river's gift of clear water, I am responsible for caring for the river. Kimmerer noted that learning and practicing these responsibilities is "an integral part of a human's education."[xxx-braiding sweetgrass|allegiance to gratitude]

In other words, people of healthy cultures do not just avoid polluting the Earth; they actively support the nonhuman communities where they live.

<div class="rev-act"><div class="rev-act-header">Revolutionary Activity #4<br/>Practice the joy of reciprocity</div>
<div class="rev-act-body">Do something kind and no-strings-attached for someone who has done something kind for you, or for anybody who looks like they need help. Get creative with what you can offer, such as helping move heavy things, babysitting someone's kid, helping them find a job, or cooking a meal for a sick person. Practice feeling gratitude for what they've given you. Do not give in exchange or to "pay them back" because this is not a trade. Savor the pleasure of giving to someone just for the joy of giving.</div></div>

<div class="rev-act"><div class="rev-act-header">Revolutionary Activity #5<br/>Practice giving first**</div>
<div class="rev-act-body">How can you form new friendships where sharing is the norm? Someone needs to give first to start that relationship of generous reciprocity.<br/><br/>Think of three ways you could give something to a total stranger, not knowing or caring whether or not they would respond generously. It could be simple like holding a door for someone, or mentoring a child, or making a nutritious meal for someone who's sick or recovering from childbirth. Don't have any expectation of return, but just give to strangers in ways that, even if the relationship ended immediately after your giving, it would be ok. Notice which people show gratitude and give back in their own ways over time, and what relationships of reciprocity form.<br/><br/>When I was 12, I was in the lunch line in school, and a boy ahead of me discovered he didn't have money for lunch. I didn't know him, but I offered to buy him lunch, and he become one of my best friends. This taught me to give first before I've received anything from someone, and just see what happens.</div></div>

### Carry Your Gifts with Conviction

I believe that a person's spirituality is simply how they relate to themselves and the world. Is there an authoritarian god-figure scaring everyone into obedience? Is the world just a bunch of molecules moving around aimlessly? Or are we all divine beings, and it really matters how each of us shows up in life? The three core spiritual practices are spiritual because they teach people how to relate to the world: with practical, aware gratitude, by giving their deepest love, and living in reciprocity.

These three core spiritual practices are core to who we are as humans. You are the giving of your deepest love, just like I'm the giving of my love. Giving to others in gratitude for what we receive is who we are as humans.

People may learn to "hold back" or "shut down" parts of themselves to survive in their unhealthy culture, giving less than their deepest love. But anyone and any group can commit to embracing these practices. This book will explore how they encourage beautiful traits, including deep awareness, generosity, reciprocity, bravery, integrity, dignity, joy, and strong servant-leadership. And my more in-depth book, _One Disease One Cure_, explores these connections even further.

Is it any wonder that nations which embrace these spiritual practices are able to maintain respectful relations among their people, and between people and the Earth?

These practices aren't just for some people. Anybody could embrace them right now to cultivate and give a deeper love. And it turns out, what's good for the individual is also good for the group. As Robin Kimmerer wrote, "in order for the whole to flourish, each of us has to be strong in who we are and carry our gifts with conviction, so they can be shared with others."[xxx-braiding sweetgrass|the three sisters]

What are your gifts? What can you give or do or be that would open your heart and let it sing?

<div class="rev-act"><div class="rev-act-header">Revolutionary Activity #6<br/>Discover your own sacred gifts</div>
<div class="rev-act-body">Did you know that each person -- including you -- has sacred gifts to share? There are many ways to find them. 1) You could take time alone without distraction and feel in your heart what most matters to you, and how you can act in service of it. 2) Ask yourself what would be the most meaningful life you could imagine. 3) Notice what brings you special joy and or sparks curiosity, and build on those things. 4) Ask people around you when they have noticed you being the most joyful, enlivened, and engaged in life. 5) Notice what you feel angry about. Your anger can show you what you care about, or an injustice you want to make right.<br/><br/>If you do not get a clear answer quickly, have patience and keep asking these questions over time.</div></div>
