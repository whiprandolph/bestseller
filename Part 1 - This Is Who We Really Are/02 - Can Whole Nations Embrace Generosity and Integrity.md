## Chapter 2: Can Whole Nations Embrace Generosity and Integrity?

My time with the Ashaninka felt shocking, but it turns out their generous and respectful way of life is not exceptional at all. Many groups of people around the world, large and small, have lived with generosity and integrity towards each other for millions of years. Cooperation and mutual respect was -- and in a few places, still is -- the norm, not the exception.

What is not at all normal, in terms of our basic human nature, is how people live in the United States and every other unhealthy nation, past and present, that have dominated and warped people for millennia.

Because most people alive today have never experienced nation-wide generosity and respect, the dominant unhealthy nations can seem quite normal to us.

But they are not normal.

### No Police, No Prisons, No Widespread Crime

One striking example of how different healthy nations are compared to what we generally think of as 'normal' is their remarkable lack of prisons, police, and crime.

Can you even imagine living in a nation without crime?

I was amazed to discover that the Ashaninka had no police or prisons, yet they also seemed so relaxed and unconcerned about crime. There were no locked doors. In fact, they didn't have doors!

Avoiding crime may seem impossible in societies numbering in the thousands or more, yet many large healthy human nations have lived this way -- not just occasionally, but for millions of years.

Countless Americans and Europeans, when encountering healthy nations for the first time, have been surprised by the lack of crime or law enforcement. For example, when French Christian missionaries first visited the Huron in North America in the 1600s, they were amazed that thousands of people could get along so well without police or prisons.[xxx-huron farmers of the north|p71]

In the 1930s, when American dentist Weston Price visited many healthy nations around the world, he wrote, "few impressions can be more vivid than that of the absence of prisons and asylums."[xxx-nutr phys gen|phys ment moral deter]

Benjamin Franklin seemed equally surprised by healthy nations he visited in the 1700s: "All their government is by Counsel of the Sages. There is no Force; there are no Prisons, no officers to compel Obedience, or inflict Punishment."[xxx-lies my teacher told me|p108]

Indeed, Haudenosaunee writers noted, "We have no jails and do not need them."[xxx-basic call to consciousness|p49]

In sharp contrast, the United States, France, and every other unhealthy nation around the world spend huge amounts of time, energy, and money trying to control crime with prisons and police -- and yet so much crime and political corruption continues.

How can some nations live without police and prisons, and also no widespread crime, while other nations, chock full of police and prisons, have so much crime?

It's not as if healthy nations don't have some troubles -- in any society, people sometimes don't get along. The difference is that they address disputes in ways that maintain a baseline of mutual respect among everybody, holding people to high standards of good behavior without demanding humiliation or submission. And when mutual respect is the norm, any selfish or hurtful act stands out as something to be immediately addressed so everyone can return to that respectful baseline.

Priscilla Settee, a woman of the Cree people, described their reconciliation process where elders would consider how to bring a person "back into a balanced life" and help them "focus on what is important in life." Instead of believing that a troubled person is bad and deserves punishment, this more loving approach recognizes that the troubled person is basically good but off-balanced or missing something important. The goal is to help them regain their balance.[xxx-original instructions|definition of indigenous knowledge]

The Ju/'hoan San (these punctuation symbols refer to sounds that don't exist in English) have healing dances for people who aren't getting along, where they "put these two people next to each other so that they can come into harmony by dancing together... it's a technology of opening the heart so that healing energy can enter and so that people's hearts will be revealed to each other and any problems or enmity will go out from between them."[xxx-original instructions|peace technologies from the san bushmen of africa]

### So What's Their Secret?

How do healthy nations mostly avoid crime? Isn't selfish, violent, or otherwise bad behavior just an unfortunate part of human nature?

Actually, no. As later chapters show, when people live in respectful societies where everyone stands for what's right and gives generously as a normal way of life, the motivation to behave selfishly is greatly diminished.

And when trouble does arise, misbehaving people get counseled at first, and if necessary, the response escalates if the misbehavior continues. This gives people a chance to course-correct without the extreme stress, danger, and humiliation of being imprisoned.

Traditional Potawatomi emphasized sharing and strongly discouraged selfishness. In Robin Kimmerer's book _Braiding Sweetgrass_, she explained how anyone who took too much, to the detriment of the community, was "first counseled, then ostracized, and if the greed continued, they were eventually banished..."[xxx-braiding sweetgrass|windigo footprints]

Banishing or killing someone for severe misbehavior, like hoarding wealth or killing someone in anger, appears to have been very rare.

All these nations seem so different, each with their own ways of helping people get along, resolving disputes, and addressing anybody's selfish or hurtful behavior. But one way or another, people of healthy nations have or had ways of maintaining a baseline of mutual respect. That is, they found ways to maintain solidarity and respectful relations among everyone inside the nation as a normal way of life.

### But Can We Live This Way Today?

Yes! There are present-day examples of people who struggled with greed, discrimination, and corruption for centuries, but then founded a new healthy nation and did away with these problems. The Zapatistas were conquered by the Spanish 500 years ago, then lived under Mexican rule until their revolution in 1994. Even after so long, they remembered how to have a healthy nation, so when they were able to launch their revolution they knew how to re-establish that baseline of mutual respect amongst themselves even while under attack from the Mexican military.[xxx-odoc|ch40]

As just one example, the Zapatistas substantially reduced the sexism that women faced. When women were interviewed 20 years later in 2014, one said "The capitalists had us believing this idea... that women are not valuable." Another woman said, "The [women] suffered a lot before '94: humiliation, mistreatment, rape." But the revolution brought deep change, with one Zapatista woman saying "As women we have the same rights as men, we have the right to decide which duties we can carry out in the communities..." Another woman said, "in those [Mexican] organizations there are many problems of rape and mistreatment, while with us, Zapatistas, it is not that way..."[xxx-opendemocracy zapatista women law as it is lived today]

The Zapatistas show that even people who have lived with sexism, greed, and corruption for centuries can still come together, create a healthy nation, and choose to live without these troubles.

Of course, there are many stories of individual Americans or small groups pulling together in times of crisis or generally acting with kindness toward others. But a whole nation? Or even a whole town? Besides the Ashaninka, I have never seen a whole nation or town of honest, giving, respectful people. Have you?

And yet as I read more about various healthy nations, I kept finding stories in which whole towns and even whole nations routinely acted with kindness and respect toward every member.

Nancy Basket, a woman of Cherokee descent, described how such kindness was maintained even as villages grew. When traditional Cherokee towns got larger than 600-700 people, hunting and foraging became difficult. Recognizing that the town needed to split into two, a new town site was agreed upon, often about seven miles away. They didn't have rich people and poor people, so that the poorest couldn't afford housing and had to leave or fend for themselves. Instead, everyone would go build the new homes and other structures regardless whether they were planning to live there or not. They even made sure all the gardens were planted.[xxx-basket interview]

People would go back and forth between the new and old sites as they prepared the new town. Everyone took responsibility for their neighbors' wellbeing. Like people in all healthy nations, they lived by the golden rule, each person treating the others the way they would want to be treated.

### Trustworthy and Generous

I kept finding stories of nations that currently or in the recent past were similar to the Ashaninka. Superficially, of course, they were and are different -- Eskimos in the arctic might have very different clothes, food, or ceremonies than the Gumbaynggirr of Australia, or the Jenu Kuruba in Asia. But I kept noticing deep, beautiful patterns that healthy nations seem to all share in common when they are able to live in a traditional way.

Besides the lack of police and prisons, I also noticed observers remarking on their deep integrity. When Ohiyesa, a Sioux man born in North America in the 1800s, visited an American city, he said, "I was cautioned against trusting strangers, and told that I must look out for pickpockets. Evidently there were some disadvantages connected with this mighty civilization, for we Indians seldom found it necessary to guard our possessions."[xxx-from deep woods to civilization|civ college life east]

American S.M. Barrett described having complete trust in Apache leader Geronimo, saying, "When he once gives his word, nothing will turn him from fulfilling his promise."[xxx-geronimo autobio|introductory]

Stanley Vestal and George Grinnell also described how they found the Sioux and Cheyenne people completely trustworthy, sounding just like my experience with the Ashaninka.[xxx-fighting cheyennes|introduction]

I remember first reading about Geronimo's integrity, and my mind went to all the untrustworthy politicians in the United States -- but also every other country I'd visited, including Ecuador, Peru, Germany, Great Britain, and Canada. Some individuals in these countries are trustworthy, but none of these nations has anything like the universal integrity I'd experienced with the Ashaninka, or like these other observers in the 1800s experienced with the Sioux, Cheyenne, and many other beautiful nations.

And it's not just trustworthiness. I kept finding stories of incredible generosity -- not just occasionally, but as a normal way of life for whole nations.

Jesuit Christian missionaries in the 1600s noted that the Huron would never let someone go without food or shelter. When someone's house burned down in the Huron village Ossossane, their neighbors came together to build a new one. Instead of having markets for trading or bartering, they embraced hospitality, gift-giving, and ceremonial exchanges. Visitors to a village were given food and shelter for as long as they wished to stay.[xxx-huron farmers of the north|p40]

The Huron would publicly announce whenever someone donated a large amount towards a feast, funeral, or ceremony, and this raised the donor's status. People thus enjoyed accumulating goods so that they could give as much as possible, and thus earn their neighbors' gratitude. Feasts were common as people sought to build up their stash of food only to give it away.[xxx-huron farmers of the north|p40]

How amazing would it be to live in a society where people don't accumulate money to hoard it and enrich themselves, but gather wealth so they can share it with their neighbors?

This wasn't unique to the Huron, and these practices aren't just from the distant past. The Tzutujil Mayans were able to maintain their traditional way of life until about 1990, and Martín Prechtel described how they had a "self-impoverished theocracy" where people "loved to get more than someone else, just so they could dress fancily and give it all away to be big." Prechtel wrote how the Tzutujil Mayans became leaders: "To get anywhere in traditional Mayan society, you had to work really hard to get wealth, get appointed to office without campaigning, and then give it all away." Each time a leader rose to a new level in their hierarchy, he or she gave away all their things so that they were equally as impoverished as everyone else.[xxx-secrets of the talking jaguar|p275]<sup>,</sup>[xxx-secrets of the talking jaguar|p210]

Haudenosaunee writers, in their book _A Basic Call to Consciousness_, described similar generosity in their traditional leaders: "To become a political leader, a person is required to be a spiritual leader; and to become a spiritual leader, a person must be extraordinarily generous in terms of material goods."[xxx-basic call to consciousness|p104]

### When Even Prisoners of War Don't Want to Leave

All this could easily seem too good to be true, except for another kind of story I kept finding: stories of people born in unhealthy nations running away to live in healthy nations.

Benjamin Franklin also noticed this, saying "No European who has tasted [Indian] Life can afterwards bear to live in our societies."[xxx-lies my teacher told me|p107] Many enslaved people who escaped European bondage also ran away to live with healthy nations.[xxx-lies my teacher told me|p108]

Even when people of unhealthy nations were captured in war, they commonly liked living in a respectful society so much that they wanted to stay. When the French and Haudenosaunee engaged in an exchange of war prisoners in 1699, Cadwallader Colden noted how the French didn't want to return home after experiencing life in a healthy nation: "...notwithstanding the French Commissioners took all the Pains possible to carry Home the French, that were Prisoners with the [Haudenosaunee], and they had full Liberty from the Indians, few of them could be persuaded to return."[xxx-beyond geography|possession]

French prisoners of war had lived in a non-abusive society and liked it so much that few could be persuaded to go home. Colden noticed that this wasn't unique to the French, as "the English had as much Difficulty" and he wrote that this uneven prisoner exchange "has been found true on many other Occasions."[xxx-beyond geography|possession]

This was obviously humiliating for colonial leaders who pretended not to abusively exploit their citizens, but it got worse. In a big prisoner exchange on the Muskingum River in 1764, white people had won out against the local healthy nations in war, but European leaders found the prisoner exchange unsatisfying. People of healthy nations who had been trapped in European prisons ran back to their communities with great joy. But when "civilized" Europeans got a little taste of living in a society where integrity, sharing, and reciprocity were a way of life, many desperately wanted to stay.[xxx-beyond geography|possession]

In fact, many white captives had to be _dragged away with their hands and feet tied_ to keep them from running back to the healthy nation they'd been able to experience.[xxx-beyond geography|possession]

These healthy nations were a major threat to colonial leaders, because they showed that it was possible to live in a respectful way, without a few people ruling over the rest, without rich and poor, corruption, and all the injustices that unhealthy nations always experience. This explains why many European colonial leaders deliberately spread lies and hateful propaganda, such as calling people of healthy nations devil-worshippers and savages. Many colonial leaders in North America also punished anybody who tried to run away to live with nearby healthy nations.[xxx-lies my teacher told me|p107]

### Deep Respect, Even when Capturing Prisoners of War

For a while I wondered how healthy nations could keep prisoners of war if they don't have prisons. I also had heard of healthy nations killing their captives -- how does that square with being a culture based on generosity and integrity?

There are three ways to deal with war captives that allow a nation to maintain a baseline of mutual respect internally: release the captive, kill them, or integrate them and treat them well. Killing or releasing captives maintains that baseline of mutual respect among everyone within the nation, and even killing can be an act of service to one's neighbors if it helps protect the group. But once captives are accepted as residents, they are treated respectfully too.**

People of healthy nations openly acknowledged that in traditional times they treated their captives with respect, as that baseline of mutual respect really does apply to anyone within the nation. Ohiyesa wrote, "It was a point of honor in the old days to treat a captive with kindness."[xxx-indian heroes and great chieftains|sitting bull]

Pretty Shield, a woman of the Crow nation, described how even captive people were treated with the same decency as everyone else. When asked about captured women, she said, "because they were treated well they never tried to get away. They had the same rights as Crow women, and worked no harder." A Lakota woman named Good-trader was captured by the Crows and ended up having a loving family and later refused to return to the Lakota when she had the chance.[xxx-red mother|p173]

Healthy nations do not incorporate captives as a permanent underclass of servants, which would create exploitative relationships within the nation. Even in the difficult situations created by war, healthy nations ensure they keep that internal baseline of mutual respect.

These stories show that the Ashaninka's beauty isn't unique. Every nation is different, but there are common patterns that allow whole nations to maintain a baseline of mutual respect internally. People embrace integrity and generosity towards their neighbors, and have systems of conflict resolution that work while avoiding unaccountable police and punitive prisons. Because generosity was or is so common, they don't have rich and poor, and leaders serve everyone.

How do they do it? If a group of people wanted to live in such a beautiful way, what lessons could they learn from the Ashaninka and all these other healthy nations to make that possible?
