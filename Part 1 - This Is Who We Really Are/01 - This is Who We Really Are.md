## Chapter 1: This Is Who We Really Are

I have really good news!

If you're like most people (and like me until recently), you probably think that racism, sexism, greed, corruption, and many other troubles are an intrinsic part of basic human nature, or inescapable aspects of every nation around the world.

The good news is this: it is possible to live without these troubles.

In fact, it's not just possible to live in a society without discrimination, selfishness, child abuse, and pollution; for thousands of years this was the normal way for humans to live -- and in some places, it still is.

I'm not talking about a weird cult or tiny communities of saints. I'm talking about hundreds of millions of people living in a beautiful way over millennia, all around the world, with no police, prisons, poverty, abuse, or hatred. Nations where sharing is a normal way of life, neighbors deeply trust each other, leaders serve the people, and visitors are treated like family.

Does this sound like a fantasy? I thought so too, until I was blessed to live briefly in such a place, a nation of thousands of people living across many villages deep in the Amazon forests. 

My short time with the Ashaninka in 2015 was utterly magical and changed my life. An Englishman named Mike had been visiting the Ashaninka yearly for 35 years and respected them deeply, and when he saw that I would respect them too, he invited me to join him. He told me, "you will spend the rest of your life figuring out lessons to learn from these people."**

What I've learned is nothing short of revolutionary for those of us not living this way now.

Part One of this book is about the first lesson: _Integrity, bravery, generosity, service, and intimate connection with the Earth -- these are who we really are as humans_. Discrimination, hatred, greed, corruption, and exploitation are not part of human nature, they're not inevitable, and whole nations of people can live without them. Part Two explores _how we lost our way_, why some cultures are stuck with these troubles generation after generation. Part Three calls for _The Deepest Revolution_: our current unhealthy cultures must change, and it will take tremendous integrity, solidarity, and bravery to do it.

### Meet the Ashaninka

Before we entered Ashaninka territory, Mike said to expect exceptional generosity. But nothing prepared me for what I found. Everywhere I went, no matter what was happening, I was constantly offered food, drink, a place to rest, and a chance to join their feasts and entertainment, and generally invited into their culture as if I weren't a strange white American man who didn't even speak their language. They just welcomed me without asking anything in return.

For example, whenever my host and I traveled around the region and needed to rest, we would stop at the next house and the hostess would bring us a fermented pink drink called peorentsi, along with some simple and filling food. They didn't do this because I was a special guest. Every traveler who needed to rest received food and drink with no expectation of trading or paying.

Dinners were likewise times of generous sharing, where people would bring the fish they'd caught, animals they'd hunted, and food they'd grown or found, and cook it up together over a fire in communal meals. No one counted who brought how much food, or who ate how much -- people just shared, and every meal was fun. I never understood what they said unless my host translated to Spanish, but their joy and laughter were infectious.

Back in the United States, many people call work a "grind" or "rat race," but I never saw a single Ashaninka grinding, no matter what they were doing. One story really showed me how unstressful their work was: I once saw an older woman sitting outside on a mat, spinning cotton into yarn on a drop spindle. At first she sat upright, rhythmically working the drop spindle. After a while, she leaned over onto her elbow and worked the drop spindle from that relaxed position. Eventually, she leaned all the way over and took a nap, the spindle resting beside her. Later she was upright again, spinning away.

No boss was pushing her to do unsatisfying work just to eat and pay the bills. She had no bills. In fact, I never saw anyone exchange money while I was there. People worked when they wanted to work, rested when they wanted to rest, and shared whatever they produced.

Everywhere I looked, it was like a story too good to be true. Their kids were friendly and very capable. A little girl of 5 or 6 showed me how to spin cotton into yarn. She seemed like quite the expert. A boy of about 10 finished making an arrow as I watched, then invited me to target practice with his hand-made bow.

These self-sufficient people needed no police or prisons. Each member took responsibility for themselves and the good of the group. While I never saw any emotional outbursts or disputes, they were very willing to use violence to protect themselves if attacked. While walking between villages, I saw young men carry shotguns over their shoulders for protection from drug traffickers. 

Even their leaders surprised me. When I arrived at one very far-away village, a small man greeted us with a warm smile and helped my friends and me settle in. I later learned he was the village leader -- not because he had any special authority or power, or was richer than anyone else, was intimidating, or had powerful parents. He was a leader because that was how he served his neighbors.

Given their integrity and generosity, I wasn't surprised that no one seemed concerned about robbery. I never saw a building with doors, much less locks. Few of their houses even had walls!

On Mike's suggestion, I made sure to bring a large sack of goods with me as gifts, including material for fishing, sewing, cooking, and anything else Mike had said they would find useful. I spent hundreds of dollars on it, and when they told me I could leave it in a home far from the village where I would be staying, I hesitated at first. Yet when I returned 2 weeks later with many Ashaninka to give out the gifts, I found the sack untouched, just as I had left it. This kind of widespread integrity was normal and unremarkable.

As I handed out the gifts, they seemed genuinely grateful, and no one asked for more. I felt happy to share but sad too that I didn't have more to give. 

When it was time for me to go a week later, I did not want to say good-bye. All the Ashaninka I met seemed trustworthy, generous, capable, responsible, relaxed, joyful, and healthy -- not just one or two individuals, but everyone I found. They had no courts, no police, no prisons, and no government, though I did see people gathering in council on my last day as they discussed how to respond to Peruvians who were overfishing the nearby river.

### Returning to the United States

I left the Ashaninka feeling both elated and confused.

A few months later, my father asked me what I had learned. I told him that I didn't know yet, and I was still figuring it out. But I knew this: people can live differently. We can treat each other well. I knew it was possible, and I would never doubt it again because I saw it with my own eyes.

The more I looked around in my own culture, the United States, the more urgent it seemed to figure out those lessons. Deceit, selfishness, ignorance, and unnecessary misery seem pervasive.

For example, the American legal system doesn't actually guarantee a fair trial like I learned growing up. It turns out that 98% of prisoners don't get a trial at all -- prosecutors commonly threaten people with decades in prison, and then offer them a plea bargain. People are offered a prison sentence of only a few years if they admit their "guilt", regardless whether they're guilty or not. Afraid of losing at trial due to racism, inability to afford a lawyer, police deceit, or other reasons, many people accept this offer. So for 98% of prisoners, the legal system and public have no idea whether they're actually guilty!

I realized that driving past a prison is like driving past a chattel slave plantation from two centuries ago: the slaves didn't "deserve" to be there; they were just captured and enslaved and put to work, or else they'd get punished. How are present-day prisoners in any different situation, if only 2% got a trial by jury where they actually got a chance to defend themselves in court? Prisoners cannot legally refuse to work either, just like chattel slaves of the past. It's like an ancient injustice just changed form, but never really went away.

Everywhere I look in my town, I see the same kind of corruption, each industry in its own way.

I went grocery shopping, and found that almost everything for sale causes cancer, immune disorders, developmental disorders, and other troubles: from pesticides in the food, to plastic wrapping, to non-stick coatings on pans. 

Going to a pharmacy, I saw the same corruption there: drug after drug produced by pharmaceutical companies with a long track record of fraud, bribing government officials, manipulating research trials, misleading advertising, and more.

The Ashaninka don't have corruption like this. What lessons could I possibly learn from them to make this nightmare end?

I drive past all the major banks every day -- the same banks that keep getting "caught" every few years laundering money for drug cartels and human trafficking organizations, or forging legal paperwork to defraud homeowners, cheating their own customers, or whatever the next scam-of-the-day is.

These pharmaceutical companies and banks get dinged with little "cost of doing business" fines by the government, and nothing much changes. The predatory and selfish behavior continues -- not by outsiders, but mostly people within my own culture! How come the Ashaninka are able to maintain respectful relations between everyone, and in America, it seems like rich Americans are the biggest threat that the poor Americans face?

Almost all of America's drinking water is now toxic, with different regions having their own mix of heavy metals, microplastics, and other chemicals. Chemical and fossil fuel companies don't seem to care about the long term effects of the products they sell.

Forests keep getting cleared to make way for strip malls and suburban lots, while scientists sound the alarm that loss of forests is a major driver of climate change and the mass extinction happening right now.

I find disturbing stories at home too. My black roommate recently said that some white men had yelled at her to go back to her own country, wherever that was supposed to be. Another friend tells me stories of sexism anytime she describes her job.

These troubles put me in a pickle. I don't like being a downer, so when I'm with friends I mostly try to keep it light and positive. That means we mostly have superficial conversations about our hobbies, jobs, or other things. If we talked about the most important issues like pollution, corporate greed, dishonest politicians, and more... well, there'd be plenty to discuss, but few people are willing to talk about that. After all, if we can't do anything about it, then what's the point of acknowledging all these things anyway?

What am I supposed to learn from the Ashaninka? How can they be humans like me and other Americans, and they live in such a beautiful way, while we don't?

Are the Ashaninka unique? Did they just get lucky, and Americans didn't? Are there societies like the Ashaninka, either now or in the recent past, where people treat each other and the Earth with respect, without discrimination, greed, and dishonest leaders? If so, could they help clarify the lessons that the Ashaninka have to offer?

It turns out, yes, there are more societies like the Ashaninka. Countless more!

The next chapter explores how the Ashaninka are not the exception. _They are the norm_. Those of us living in unhealthy cultures that now dominate much of the Earth are _not_ the norm. 

Widespread racism, sexism, child abuse, pollution, corruption, crime, domestic violence, and all the rest may seem "just the way life is," but that's not true. The Ashaninka and so many other healthy cultures show us who we really are as humans. These troubles are not the result of supposedly-selfish human nature. If enough of us wake up and cultivate the courage, we can live without these troubles again.
