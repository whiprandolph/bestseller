## Chapter 5: Why Doesn't Everybody Live in This Beautiful Way?

For years, I studied beautiful traditional cultures like the Lakota and Potawatomi, and I wondered what they have or had in common. In traditional stories from all these healthy cultures, just like I had seen with the Ashaninka, they seem to avoid crime without having any police or prisons. Integrity and generosity are pervasive, and they have leaders that people actually want to follow. It's normal for people to accept deep responsibility to treat each other and the Earth in a good way. Why do some cultures have these beautiful qualities?

I also kept studying unhealthy cultures, like Russia, Great Britain, Canada, and the United States, and I kept noticing common patterns there too, like racism, sexism, self-serving political leaders, pollution, and more. What causes those cultures to be so unhealthy, generation after generation?

Do cultures become unhealthy when the population gets too large? Some academic literature states that humans can only maintain tight knit communities of up to 150 people, a limit called "Dunbar's number." I commonly hear people claim that humans start behaving inappropriately towards each other in groups larger than 150, as accountability mechanisms supposedly start to break down then.

But that doesn't make sense. The Ashaninka number more than 2,000 and maintain a generous, relaxed culture where everyone is treated respectfully.

The Cherokee in 1674 CE numbered approximately 50,000 and likewise maintained that internal baseline of mutual respect amongst themselves.

Do cultures become unhealthy when they cover too much area? That doesn't make sense either. As of the early 1700s, the Haudenosaunee Confederacy covered over 38,000 square miles. This is comparable in size to Switzerland, Bhutan, or Taiwan. If the Haudenosaunee were a US state, it would be the 38th largest, between Kentucky and Indiana.

Before extended European contact, the Cherokee covered approximately 40,000 sq miles. Clearly humans can maintain healthy cultures that cover huge distances and include many thousands of people.

Did the trouble happen when people started farming? No, the Huron gained about 75% of the food they ate from crops they grew. They still shocked French missionaries who couldn't understand how people could get along without police, prisons, and authorities imposing law and order. Even prior to contact with European colonizers, the Haudenosaunee relied more on farming than hunting for food.

Sometimes people of these cultures are called native, indigenous, tribal, indian, or first nations. I call them healthy human cultures!

And they all share one core difference from all unhealthy human cultures:

<center>__*In healthy cultures, everyone stands for a culture of mutual respect, and nobody rules over anybody else.*__</center>

In healthy cultures, people expect each other to _uphold_ their law. In unhealthy cultures, people are expected to _obey_ the laws they're given, but they're punished for upholding the law themselves -- after all, that is the police's job, though the police have to follow orders too.

In healthy cultures, everyone stands for a culture of mutual respect, so they have strong leaders and nobody imposes law on anybody else. Everyone agrees on their rules for appropriate behavior, so they can live in a respectful way with each other and the Earth. And when someone behaves inappropriately, anyone may take initiative to hold that person accountable. Such healthy cultures may fight with each other, but within the culture, they maintain a baseline of mutual respect.

In unhealthy human cultures, one person or a few people rule over everyone else. Whether the rulers are kings, billionaires, imams, priests, prime ministers, or presidents, they impose laws that everyone else must follow or face severe punishment. The rulers choose how to enforce the law, and forbid everybody else from taking initiative to hold misbehaving people accountable.

Rulers use all manner of tricks, traps, and childhood training to create and maintain obedience. In fact, racism, sexism, dishonest leadership, pollution, disconnection from nature, selfishness, widespread child abuse, and poverty are all merely _common symptoms caused by the root cultural disease where some people rule over everyone else, and people accept their own submissive obedience as legitimate and normal_.**

Every single culture where a person or group imposes law on the rest has these terrible troubles. But these troubles don't exists in societies where everyone stands for what's right, and everyone agrees on the rules they will live by.

That is very good news! It means there is a way to end all the most terrible troubles we face. There is a way to end discrimination, greed, pollution, and so many other problems. While not easy, our pathway to freedom is simple: work together to create new nations where everyone agrees on their laws and everyone bravely upholds them as a normal way of life, taking humans' and nonhumans' needs into account.**

Part 3 of this book will explore how you can work with others to create that beautiful way of life. It will require tremendous hard work, bravery and risk, and _it's worth it_.**

But to understand why it's worth the risk, we must confront the tragic truth of how deeply sick all unhealthy cultures are. The truth is that _your unhealthy culture is a trap_ that keeps you and the people around you stuck in an unsatisfying way of life, generation after generation. We have to understand the trap we're in or else we'll never be able to free ourselves and build truly healthy cultures. And that means confronting the deepest patterns of manipulation that have kept people trapped for centuries or even millennia -- even in so-called "democracies."**

Many people avoid watching the news or thinking too deeply because "why bother?" If you can't do anything about it, why worry? But the truth is that you can do something about it -- most people just haven't heard the perspectives and stories that offer a helpful path.**

So let's be brave together, and face the truth of unhealthy cultures so we can see clearly why our current way of life isn't working, and why it never has.**
