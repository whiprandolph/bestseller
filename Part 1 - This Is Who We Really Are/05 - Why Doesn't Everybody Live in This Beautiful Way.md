## Chapter 5: Why Doesn't Everybody Live in This Beautiful Way?

For years, I studied beautiful traditional cultures like the Lakota and Potawatomi, and I wondered what they have or had in common. In traditional stories from all these healthy cultures, just like I had seen with the Ashaninka, they seem to avoid crime without having any police or prisons. Integrity and generosity are pervasive, and they have leaders that people actually want to follow. It's normal for people to accept deep responsibility to treat each other and the Earth in a good way. Why do some cultures have these beautiful qualities?

I also kept studying unhealthy cultures, like Russia, Great Britain, Canada, and the United States, and I kept noticing common patterns there too, such as racism, sexism, self-serving political leaders, and pollution. What causes those cultures to be so unhealthy, generation after generation?

Do cultures become unhealthy when the population gets too large? Some academic literature states that humans can only maintain tight knit communities of up to 150 people, a limit called "Dunbar's number." I commonly hear people claim that humans start behaving inappropriately towards each other in groups larger than 150, as accountability mechanisms supposedly start to break down then.

But that doesn't make sense. The Ashaninka number more than 2,000 and maintain a generous, relaxed culture where everyone is treated respectfully.

The Cherokee in 1674 CE numbered approximately 50,000 and likewise maintained that internal baseline of mutual respect amongst themselves.

Do cultures become unhealthy when they cover too much area? That doesn't make sense either. As of the early 1700s, the Haudenosaunee Confederacy covered over 38,000 square miles. This is comparable in size to Switzerland, Bhutan, or Taiwan. If the Haudenosaunee were a US state, it would be the 38th largest, between Kentucky and Indiana.

Before extended European contact, the Cherokee covered approximately 40,000 sq miles. Clearly humans can maintain healthy cultures that cover huge distances and include many thousands of people.

Did the trouble happen when people started farming? No, the Huron gained about 75% of the food they ate from crops they grew. They still shocked French missionaries who couldn't understand how people could get along without police, prisons, and authorities imposing law and order. Even prior to contact with European colonizers, the Haudenosaunee relied more on farming than hunting for food.

Sometimes people of these cultures are called native, indigenous, tribal, indian, or first nations. I call them healthy human cultures!

And they all share one core difference from all unhealthy human cultures:

<center>__*In healthy cultures, everyone stands for a culture of mutual respect, and nobody rules over anybody else.*__</center>

In healthy cultures, people expect each other to _uphold_ their law. In unhealthy cultures, people are expected to _obey_ the laws they're given, but they're punished for upholding the law themselves -- after all, that is the police's job, though the police have to follow orders too.

In healthy cultures, everyone stands for a culture of mutual respect, so they have strong leaders and nobody imposes law on anybody else. Everyone agrees on their rules for appropriate behavior, so they can live in a respectful way with each other and the Earth. And when someone behaves inappropriately, anyone may take initiative to hold that person accountable. Such healthy cultures may fight with each other, but within the culture, they maintain a baseline of mutual respect.

In unhealthy human cultures, one person or a few people rule over everyone else. Whether the rulers are kings, billionaires, imams, priests, prime ministers, or presidents, they impose laws that everyone else must follow or face severe punishment. The rulers choose how to enforce the law, and forbid everybody else from taking initiative to hold misbehaving people accountable.

Rulers use all manner of tricks, traps, and childhood training to create and maintain obedience. In fact, racism, sexism, dishonest leadership, pollution, disconnection from nature, selfishness, widespread child abuse, and poverty are all merely _common symptoms caused by the root cultural disease where some people rule over everyone else, and people accept their own submissive obedience as legitimate and normal_.**

Every single culture where a person or group imposes law on the rest has the same kinds of terrible troubles. For example, racism might "look" different in one unhealthy culture compared to another because they have different ethnicities. But they all have some kind of racism, where some groups are higher-privilege, and some are lower-privilege. And these troubles don't exist in societies where everyone stands for what's right, and everyone agrees on the rules they will live by.**

That is very good news! It means there is a way to end all the most terrible troubles we face. There is a way to end discrimination, greed, pollution, and so many other problems. While not easy, our pathway to freedom is simple: work together to create new nations where everyone agrees on their laws and everyone bravely upholds them as a normal way of life, taking humans' and nonhumans' needs into account.**

In order to find a pathway to freedom and live without these terrible troubles, we must first be clear on what "freedom" even means.

### Spiritual Strength and Freedom**

Spiritual strength is foundational for maintaining a free society. But what do "freedom" and "spiritual strength" even mean?

You have _spiritual strength_ if you give your deepest love in each moment without holding back. Spiritual strength exists when you're clear on your sacred gifts and you give them each moment. In other words, you're clear about what matters to you and act in service of it. You may feel uncertain or scared or angry, but regardless how you feel or what's going on around you, you give your deepest love. You stand for what's right no matter what.

_Freedom_ exists when everyone in your culture expects you to have this spiritual strength as a normal way of life. In other words, your neighbors expect nothing less than your deepest bravery and integrity as you uphold the laws you live by so that justice becomes normal. _In a free society, your neighbors expect you to offer your deepest love and stand for what's right, rather than punishing you for it._

However, if you live in a society with a ruling class, the police are the only ones allowed to enforce the law (and they have to follow orders). This means your unhealthy culture punishes you for seeking justice, even while abuses and corruption happen all around you. In unhealthy cultures, no one has that freedom to uphold their own laws -- not even the rich.

In unfree societies, people can learn to "hold back" or "shut down" parts of themselves and not even notice it just to get along in their unhealthy culture, developing all sorts of emotional or spiritual wounds. This will be explored in Part 2 and Part 3. These troubles represent a loss of that spiritual strength.

You can still give your deepest love no matter what, even if you're trapped in an unhealthy culture that punishes people for standing for seeking justice. In other words, _you can have that spiritual strength even if you don't have freedom._

This clarifies why _freedom is built on spiritual strength_: when everyone in a nation gives their love and seeks justice in solidarity with others, then each person welcomes everyone else to do that too. When spiritual strength is normal in a nation, your neighbors simply expect you to stand in solidarity with others so nobody experiences injustice.

When too many people "hold back" or "shut down" parts of themselves and learn to tolerate abuses all around, then we wind up with societies that punish people for standing for justice.Everyone in a nation must have that _spiritual strength_ to give their deepest love and stand for what's right so that collectively they can have _freedom_ where people are encouraged rather than punished for give their deepest love.

### Let's Be Brave Together

Part 3 of this book will explore how you can work with others to create a beautiful way of life, a nation of spiritually strong people living in actual freedom. It will require tremendous hard work, bravery and risk, and _it's worth it_.**

But to understand why it's worth the risk, we must confront the tragic truth of how deeply sick all unhealthy cultures are. Anytime a ruling class takes hold, deep selfishness and predatory behavior become widespread and normalized. And since "selfishness" and "corruption" are the same, that means widespread corruption also becomes normalized.**

The truth is that _your unhealthy culture is a trap_ that keeps you and the people around you stuck in an unsatisfying way of life, generation after generation. And that means confronting the deepest patterns of manipulation that have kept people trapped in unfree societies for centuries or even millennia -- even in so-called "democracies." Only with this deep understanding can we free ourselves and build truly healthy, free nations.**

Many people avoid watching the news or thinking too deeply because "why bother?" If you can't do anything about it, why worry? But the truth is that you can do something about it -- most people just haven't heard the perspectives and stories that offer a helpful path.**

The perspectives in Part 2 may seem very scary, and it is hard to face scary things alone. So let's be brave together, and face the truth of unhealthy cultures so we can see clearly why our current way of life isn't working, and why it never has. We will also uncover aspects of spiritual strength, and how people can build up each other's spiritual strength on the path to building new healthy cultures together.**

To confront the deep sickness in every unhealthy culture and learn ways to build spiritual strength, join me in _Part 2 - Why Are We So Lost?_**
