### Nootka story from Chap 3
(to add:
  * I'd only ever lived in or visited cultures with police, prisons, and imposed law. How do people live in a respectful way with each other without these things? What happens when trouble arises? (Weston Price, Jesuit Missionaries and me all noticed no police+prisons)
  * what personal qualities do they emphasize to maintain these boundaries/agreements (agreements+integrity)
  * selfishness seen as core element to avoid
  * shared agreements/accountability
  * why there'd be no racism or sexism within the culture -- when everyone takes a responsibility to stand for what's right, there's no room for that nonsense
)
### The Nootka Stand in Solidarity

In _Daughters of Copper Woman_, a Nootka storyteller described a cultural technique the Nootka used to help people see their own foolish behavior: clowns.

These weren't clowns with big noses and bright costumes, and they didn't just act silly. Clowns were like magazine opinion writers who commented on all sorts of things. If a clown thought that the council was about to do something foolish, they might show up at council and imitate one of the leaders' every movement so that "every little wart on that person would show, every hole in their idea would suddenly look real big."[xxx-daughters of copper woman|109-112]

If a person were vain about their clothes, a clown might follow behind them wearing tattered rags and their hair would be like a bird's nest full of mud and sticks, all looking similar to the vain person. If a person had a bad temper, a clown might follow and have fits, hitting the sand with a rock or insulting birds and generally looking foolish. If a person became self-important, the clown might follow along babbling like a baby, "until you finally heard what an ass you were bein'." And if a clown started being mean or pushy, a second clown might follow along and let the first clown see how they were showing up.

The Nootka storyteller noted, "nobody would ever dare blow up at the clown!" Anyone who did would be shamed. Clowns did not make fun of people or act hurtfully. They helped people see what they looked like to others and how silly it was to put so much emphasis on unimportant things like clothes or jewelry, "instead of what counts, like bein' nice to people, and bein' lovin'..."

Christians arrived and started dividing up the land. They set up a church, and began trying to get the Nootka to attend, offering mirrors and other trinkets as enticements. At church, the preacher told them what to wear, how to live, and what to do. He insisted that men shouldn't wear kilts, and women should only have long dresses that covered them completely. He kept saying that everyone should live and dress like the white man.

One day, a clown from a nearby community arrived at the church. Like the white man, she wore a big black hat and a black jacket. She even wore old rundown shoes someone had thrown away. Unlike the white man, she wore nothing else. She moved to the front and waited for church to start.

The preacher got very upset, but everyone else looked at her respectfully. No one mocked her or looked away to avoid her nudity.

The preacher started ranting about nudity, naked women, sin, and respect for God. Then he came down from his pulpit and grabbed the clown to throw her out.

Acting violently towards a clown was absolutely not allowed, and the storyteller said, "The people just about ripped him apart." But the clown protected him from the crowd, went up to where the preacher had been, and addressed them in their own language: "She said we were all brothers and sisters... And she said different people had different ways of doin' things, and that didn't mean any one way was Right or any other way was Wrong, it just meant all ways were different."

The clown encouraged empathy, asking people to imagine how a stranger might feel, being away from home, surrounded by people who looked and acted differently. She added, "there was more than one kind of mirror. There was the white man's mirror that you got if you went to church, but there was the mirror in the eyes of the people you loved..." The clown walked out of church, and all the people followed her, leaving the preacher alone. That church still exists and remains empty to this day.

This clown was very brave. I feel impressed that she invited her neighbors to have compassion for a stranger and see his perspective even after he'd acted rudely. I also feel amazed that the people quickly recognized who was in the right and acted in support of the mostly-naked woman instead of the self-righteous man. This story showed me that whole communities can act in solidarity and stand for a culture of mutual respect when conflict arises.

This story showed me what it's like when everyone in a culture upholds the rules for how people treat each other. The Nootka didn't have police; everybody took a stand to protect the clown when she was attacked. They had rules that worked for everyone, and everyone upheld them.

### The Golden Rule of Healthy Cultures

I used to wonder if it was possible to make rules or agreements that apply the same to everyone so that there are no favorites. I now believe the answer is clear: shared agreements can apply equally when everyone is willing to stand for that baseline of mutual respect.

The golden rule states "Treat others as I would want to be treated." I believe real solidarity comes from _the golden rule of healthy cultures_: "stand with others as I would want them to stand with me."

When a Cherokee town grew too big, the Cherokee didn't have to worry so much whether they would leave or stay because everybody stood for the needs of the movers. The Okanagans don't need to worry about whether they were in the minority and try to form alliances, as everyone stands for each others' needs through the process of en'owkinwiwx. The clown stood for a peaceful culture where people could feel unashamed of their bodies, and when a preacher man behaved disrespectfully toward her, the Nootka stood with her.

This solidarity, stemming from the responsibility for reciprocity, is healthy and natural. It is who we are as humans. 

### From chap 4 - first 2 sections

During my time with the Ashaninka, it was obvious to me that they had clear standards of behavior, respect for each other, and respect for their shared space. Nobody had to tell me this; I could clearly see that everyone acted respectfully. I asked a few questions, like where to poop and not to poop. But besides such practical matters, there wasn't much to discuss. Their expectations for each other just made sense and applied the same to everybody. It was easy to get along.

I believe this is a core, defining pattern among healthy cultures: everyone agrees on their shared standards of behavior. And to ensure their shared standards of behavior apply equally to everyone, anyone in the community can seek accountability if someone violates a standard.

Shared standards of behavior and shared responsibility for holding each other accountable eliminates the need for imposed laws and designated law-enforcers.  Everyone agrees on standards of behavior and everyone has the responsibility to hold anyone else accountable if those standards of behavior are violated. Different healthy cultures have different procedures for responding to misbehavior, but it would be unthinkable to ignore the trouble if these procedures weren't being followed or if they weren't working.

The shared standards that allow mutually respectful relationships don't just apply to people, but to nonhumans too. The third core spiritual practice is living in reciprocity, and thus standards of behavior include how people treat nonhumans too. Shared standards of behavior are grounded in spiritual practice and a larger natural truth. I believe this is why Mohawk man Mike McDonald said, "That's where our laws have always come from. That is where our ceremonies have come from. They've always come from those people who learn to listen, who learn to see, who learn to be close to the natural world."[xxx-seeing through native eyes|track27]

Healthy cultures may have widely varying standards of behavior. For example, cultures with little access to water take care not to waste a single drop, while others have so much water that they seem less concerned with using it efficiently. But at a fundamental level, everyone collectively agrees on how they are going to live with each other and the land in ways that work for everyone, humans and nonhumans.

### Stories of Healthy Cultures Addressing Unwanted Behavior

If healthy cultures do not have police or prisons or judges, how do they address trouble when someone behaves inappropriately?

I have observed all kinds of responses to hurtful or disrespectful behavior, from gentle to extremely firm. In general, I believe each group does what they believe would help them return to and maintain a core baseline of mutual respect within the group.

Priscilla Settee, a woman of the Cree people, described their reconciliation process where elders would consider how to bring a person "back into a balanced life" and help them "focus on what is important in life." Instead of believing that a troubled person is bad and deserves punishment, this more loving approach recognizes that the troubled person is basically good but off-balanced or missing something important. The goal is to help them recover their balance.[xxx-original instructions|definition of indigenous knowledge]

Megan Biesele and Ju/'hoan San man Kxao =Oma (these punctuation symbols refer to sounds that don't exist in English) described the Ju/'hoan San healing dances where "they try to put these two people next to each other so that they can come into harmony by dancing together... What people have told me about what's going on in these beautiful dances is that it's a technology of opening the heart so that healing energy can enter and so that people's hearts will be revealed to each other and any problems or enmity will go out from between them."[xxx-original instructions|peace technologies from the san bushmen of africa]

While the response is grounded in love and respect for the individual, maintaining the baseline of mutual respect within the group is paramount.

Depending on the nature of the misbehavior, temporary or permanent banishment has been used in a number of communities for certain troubles. Potawatomi woman Robin Kimmerer explained how anyone who took too much, to the detriment of the community, was "first counseled, then ostracized, and if the greed continued, they were eventually banished... It is a terrible punishment to be banished from the web of reciprocity, with no one to share with you and no one for you to care for."[xxx-braiding sweetgrass|windigo footprints]

The traditional Cherokee also used banishment if someone behaved inappropriately. First the troubled person would receive counseling from clan and spiritual elders and the gigau, meaning beloved woman. If this did not address the trouble, they would be shunned outside their home, then ostracized in their town, and if needed, eventually banished for a year from the whole community. If they were willing to make amends after this time, they would be welcomed back, and no one would speak of their past troubles again.[xxx-basket email 7/1/23]

People of healthy cultures may also choose to kill individuals who refuse to get along, hoard wealth, or show severe disrespect. For example, the Huron would threaten to kill people who continually insisted on hoarding great wealth rather than sharing, especially while neighbors were suffering.[xxx-huron farmers of the north|p87]

Nancy Basket noted that traditional Cherokee would kill a Cherokee person for two offenses: killing in anger and incest. The Cherokee did not have prisons or jails. She said, "if you tried to run away, you would be found by the warriors and thrown off a cliff. That was the coward's way to die. The brave thing to do was own up to what you've done. And you would be killed in a ball game. You'd be allowed to play one more time. There were seven men chosen, one from each of the clans. Stickball is pretty harsh. One of those seven men would strike you hard with no one knowing who delivered the final blow and you'd die during that game, but at least that was honorable."[xxx-basket email 7/25/24]

Basket described what would happen if a man accidentally killed someone: "If you accidentally killed somebody, you'd be expected to become as the person you killed, providing for that family for the rest of your life."

Violence can be productive or unproductive. Productive violence helps maintain that baseline of mutual respect, whereas unproductive violence leads to endless cycles of disrespect, retribution, and divisiveness.

It takes a deep wisdom and collective effort to decide when and how violence may be used productively. If people act violently out of ignorance or selfishness, it does not help. When the American general Harney convinced Ogallala chief Bear Bull to force his clan to submit to American dictates, the clan refused. In a drunken rage, Bear Bull angrily fired at his own people and killed Red Cloud's father and brother. Red Cloud calmly faced Bear Bull and his son who tried to defend him and he killed them both. Ohiyesa noted that "He did what he believed to be his duty, and the whole band sustained him. Indeed, the tragedy gave the young man at once a certain standing, as one who not only defended his people against enemies from without, but against injustice and aggression within the tribe. From this time on he was a recognized leader."[xxx-indian heroes and great chieftains|red cloud]

Red Cloud did not kill the abusive, corrupt chief to take power for himself. He killed the corrupt chief to reestablish the baseline of mutual respect, and his neighbors recognized this. This is how a culture can have strong leaders and no rulers. Red Cloud became a leader because people recognized him as someone who stood against injustice to his people wherever it came from.

I was surprised at first to learn that exile or death could be the response to someone who insisted on selfishly hoarding wealth even after many requests to share. How bad could wealth-hoarding really be? Then I saw the wisdom: they saw how dangerous it becomes when some people hoard their wealth while their neighbors suffer. Eventually, everyone might feel the need to hoard whatever they can just to survive! Unhealthy, abusive cultures would naturally result, and we see the consequences all around us in the United States, China, Russia, India, and elsewhere.

Based on my time with the Ashaninka and all my interviews and reading, I believe that these severe responses like killing or banishment were and are rare. After all, who wouldn't want to live in a culture that maintains a baseline of respect for everyone, where sharing is the norm?

There is no single "right" way for people to maintain that baseline of mutual respect. Every healthy culture has found their own way. Any group wanting to generate a healthy subculture must ask, "how are we going to maintain a baseline of mutual respect among ourselves?" Once that is established, they must follow _the golden rule of healthy cultures: Stand with others the way I would want them to stand with me_. I believe that when everyone in a group lives in solidarity with each other and the Earth, a healthy culture or subculture is the result.


#### From later in Chap 4 - Healthy Cultures Create and Maintain Boundaries Based on Mutual Respect

(Note: there is a lot more material in Chap 4 that could go in part 3, about boundary-setting)

In healthy cultures and subcultures, everyone agrees on the internal boundaries (rules and systems of accountability), allowing the culture to have a baseline of mutual respect. What are the rules we're going to live by? And how do we hold each other accountable when someone breaks a rule? The healthy-culture systems of accountability explored in this chapter are simply ways of maintaining healthy internal boundaries so that everyone can enjoy respectful relationships with everyone else.

A healthy culture also has external boundaries that protect it from disrespect by outsiders. This is the role of warriors: when one group wants to attack another, and words won't stop the aggression, defending warriors use violence to establish a boundary, protecting their people from external threats.

Often boundaries are energetic, not physical. A physical boundary blocks a person, whereas an energetic boundary blocks certain attitudes or types of behavior. For example, an energetic boundary might block attitudes of selfishness or racism, or behaviors like lying, theft, or taking more than one's share.

Energetic boundaries can be as firm or flexible as people choose. For example, a culture might decide they don't like selfishness, but different acts of selfishness might lead to different responses. If one person sexually attacks another, the attacker may be banished immediately instead of being allowed to grow and get a second chance. On the other hand, someone who takes a little more food than they need might be counseled and offered a chance to grow without being forced out.

When a healthy culture upholds strong energetic boundaries, it evicts anyone who shows unwanted attitudes or behaviors and refuses to change. In other words, the attitude or behavior is the problem, not the person. Later chapters explore ways to set external boundaries with collective self-defense.

Geronimo hinted at an energetic boundary when he told his biographer that he felt free to either be kind to strangers or rob them, but once a person had been accepted as a guest -- that is, once they had been welcomed inside the culture's energetic boundaries -- they would be treated just as respectfully as everyone else within the culture.

No matter how much the culture's physical boundaries moved -- say, because they traveled to a new region -- within the culture's energetic boundaries, everyone was respected by everyone else.[xxx-geronimo autobio|tribal amusements]

Likewise, when a Potawatomi or Cherokee person began acting selfishly, the group didn't instantly banish the person. I believe they commonly wanted the person to stay; they just wanted the selfishness to leave. The behavior or attitude was the problem, not the person, which is why they first received counseling and then light ostracizing. Only when the person insisted on acting selfishly did they finally remove the selfishness from within their culture by banishing the person.

This shows the power of holding energetic boundaries that allow a group to maintain an internal baseline of respect no matter what. Instead of judging a person as good or bad, judge a behavior or attitude as good or bad. This gives a wayward person a chance to grow and learn better behaviors. This way, only people who refuse to grow get banished.

Strong leaders uphold both these internal and external boundaries to ensure people can live in a respectful and peaceful way with each other. When Red Cloud killed Big Bear after he became aggressive toward his own people, Ohiyesa described how Red Cloud's people supported him because he "not only defended his people against enemies from without, but against injustice and aggression within the tribe." In other words, everyone took responsibility for deciding what was appropriate, and I believe the people respected Red Cloud because he upheld both the internal and external boundaries, ensuring his people were safe from disrespect no matter where it came from.

The third aspect of cultures involves how people live within those boundaries. How do they share? How do the live in a way that takes everyone's needs and the Earth's needs into account? How do they support themselves and enjoy life?

Both healthy and unhealthy cultures around the world show a huge diversity. There are countless ways of choosing leaders, raising children, gathering food, and everything else that humans do.

Of all the differences between healthy and unhealthy cultures, I believe the most important is how they set boundaries. In healthy cultures, everyone agrees on the rules and anyone can hold anyone else accountable for breaking the rules. In unhealthy cultures, rulers impose laws and enforce them as they wish, ensuring that some people won't be treated fairly.

There are other major differences between healthy and unhealthy cultures. For example, healthy cultures emphasize reciprocity and sharing as a norm, whereas unhealthy cultures emphasize profit. Healthy cultures have an intimate, mutually enriching relationship with the land, whereas unhealthy cultures exploit the land. These differences are explored throughout this book.

But I believe that the most important, fundamental difference is how healthy and unhealthy cultures set boundaries. If people can successfully set their own boundaries, they can decide to have a culture of sharing and close connection with the Earth, as every healthy culture does. As long as rulers and other authorities set the boundaries, it is very difficult to fully take the Earth's needs into account as a normal part of life.
