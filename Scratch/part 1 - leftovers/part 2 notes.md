## Does the Economy Reward Selfishness or Generosity?

* cascading selfishness, generosity

* debt

* gift economy vs market/command economy

Present-day example?
More you give, the less you have, the less security you have - health issues can't be paid, losing a job risks losing the house (mortgage)

## Sabotaging vs Encouraging Solidarity

* sabotaging efforts at cultural healing (Black Lives Matter, Russian secretly police-sponsored labor unions, etc)

* tricking people into not knowing healthy cultures exist - savages, etc.


vs solidarity: Cherokee town story

## Chapter 9: Selfish Violence vs Violence-In-Service (rename)
* Rulers spreading hate towards peace activists

* Wars based on lies / false flag attacks (ie 9/11, Nazi attack on Reichstag, etc)
* vs sacred circles: Apache collective self defense, CONAIE, black activists
* Zapatistas

## Chapter: Why Don't More People Know About Healthy Cultures?
* conquered people trained not to know what freedom is like - where everyone takes deep responsibility for ensuring a culture of respectful relations between the people, and between the people and the Earth

* religious hate campaigns towards pagans (odoc chap 22)

* normalize abuse / adopt authoritarian ideologies (chap 21)

* vs... what from healthy cultures?


### Endless predation

Other kinds of predation are common, with different kinds more or less common in different unhealthy cultures. 

Even soldiers are not safe from predatory behavior. Decades after scientists had established the harmful effects of nuclear radiation, the Soviet Union, United States, France, and Great Britain all knowingly exposed their soldiers to radiation without their consent. Reports from all these countries show that soldiers were expected to remain silent, even as they were left to face terrible injuries, and even as their children were born with deformities that were clearly traceable to radiation poisoning. Soldiers widely understood the risks as well. One French soldier said, "we knew these things," but authorities demanded that soldiers "obey and shut up."
