I used to like reading the news in the morning, but I realized I just kept getting angry and disoriented, so I mostly stopped.

For a long time, like a lot of people, when I read the news I got upset at stories of political corruption -- politicians lining their pockets somehow, serving themselves instead of the public good. But then I realized that that kind of selfishness is just a normal part of life.

I went to the grocery store yesterday, and someone asked me if I wanted to donate to a cancer research organization trying to find out what causes cancer and how to cure it. But the news will tell anyone what causes cancer: the large majority is caused by human-created chemicals sold for a massive profit by the chemicals industry. I looked around the grocery store and saw plastic packaging knowing that plastic rubs off on the food it covers and can cause cancer in people. The vast majority of the food contains pesticides of different kinds, many of which have been linked to cancer. Many cleaning products contain chemicals which off-gas in the home and cause cancer. The non-stick coating on some cooking pans is cancer-causing. It's bizarre and disconcerting to be surrounded by products that people manufactured to make money, while it's public knowledge that all these chemicals are known to cause cancer in the users!

What am I supposed to say to the clerk who asks me if I want to donate? I usually just say "no, thank you" but I want to scream at everyone in the store to acknowledge this terrible situation where my neighbors -- other people in my own society -- are profiting by knowingly creating cancer-causing products! And it wouldn't be so bad if it were just this way in one grocery store, but these same cancer-causing products exist in the vast majority of grocery stores everywhere I drive. Cancer is hard to escape.

It doesn't get any better when I make my next stop, the pharmacy. I see the bottles of containing their little pills, and I can't help thinking of what I learned about the companies. One anti-depressant manufacturer illegally convinced doctors to give it to kids and teenagers, even though their own research showed it to be ineffective and may cause suicidal thoughts in adolescents.[xxx-huffpost holding big pharma acct] Plenty of drug companies have been caught putting deceptive labels on their drugs, with some companies just being repeat offenders every few years! These are the biggest drug companies in the US, including Johnson & Johnson, Eli Lilly, Pfizer, Merck, and GlaxoSmithKline. How am I supposed to trust any of these bottles of medicines contain what the labels say they contain? And with the drug companies being caught repeatedly bribing doctors to hand out their drugs, how can I trust the medical experts in my life to tell me the truth?

People say the pharmaceutical companies have paid billions of fines, but these are just a cost of doing business -- about 5% of their net profits, so no wonder they keep engaging in these terrible practices. And I had the same thought as I left the pharmacy and drove past some major banks. Banks like Bank of America, JP Morgan Chase, and Citi had been publicly caught supporting illegal drug gangs, laundering money, bribing officials, stealing from customers... for decades. Just like in the pharmacy and grocery store, the clerks in the bank seem like hard-working people doing their best to keep their job so they can pay their food and rent bills.

It's like I'm surrounded by a few rich crooks and tons of people who need a job and try not to think about the crooks. A few executives and business owners get rich from selling drugs illegally, or putting...
