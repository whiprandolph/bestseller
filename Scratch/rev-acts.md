<div class="rev-act"><div class="rev-act-header">Revolutionary Activity #1<br/>Imagine a whole nation where people cared about each other</div>
<div class="rev-act-body">Take 5 minutes to imagine your life if everywhere you went, people welcomed you, fed you, sheltered you, protected you and included you like family. Imagine also if they trusted that you would show the same care for them as a normal way of life. How does that feel?</div></div>


<div class="rev-act"><div class="rev-act-header">Revolutionary Activity #2<br/>Did you know?</div>
<div class="rev-act-body">Are you surprised to learn that healthy cultures have existed for millions of years, including today, where people treat each other with generosity and respect? Did you think that such ways of living are unrealistic If so, what were some of your assumptions about people that you may now question?</div></div>


<div class="rev-act"><div class="rev-act-header">Revolutionary Activity #3<br/>Gratitude for the nonhumans' gifts</div>
<div class="rev-act-body">Cultivating a practical, aware gratitude begins with noticing the gifts you receive. To start, go outside and find a nonhuman to observe closely, and ask what its gifts are.<br/><br/>For example, if you observed a tree, you would ask: how does the tree benefit all the life around it, including you? One way to find out is to ask "what would be different if the tree weren't there?" Does the tree provide nest sites for birds? Does it give you privacy or provide beautiful greenery? Does it hold the soil in place to prevent erosion? Notice every gift that you can, and practice feeling grateful for them.</div></div>


<div class="rev-act"><div class="rev-act-header">Revolutionary Activity #4<br/>Practice the joy of reciprocity</div>
<div class="rev-act-body">Do something kind and no-strings-attached for someone who has done something kind for you, or for anybody who looks like they need help. Get creative with what you can offer, such as helping move heavy things, babysitting someone's kid, helping them find a job, or cooking a meal for a sick person. Practice feeling gratitude for what they've given you. Do not give in exchange or to "pay them back" because this is not a trade. Savor the pleasure of giving to someone just for the joy of giving.</div></div>


<div class="rev-act"><div class="rev-act-header">Revolutionary Activity #5<br/>Practice giving first**</div>
<div class="rev-act-body">How can you form new friendships where sharing is the norm? Someone needs to give first to start that relationship of generous reciprocity.<br/><br/>Think of three ways you could give something to a total stranger, not knowing or caring whether or not they would respond generously. It could be simple like holding a door for someone, or mentoring a child, or making a nutritious meal for someone who's sick or recovering from childbirth. Don't have any expectation of return, but just give to strangers in ways that, even if the relationship ended immediately after your giving, it would be ok. Notice which people show gratitude and give back in their own ways over time, and what relationships of reciprocity form.<br/><br/>When I was 12, I was in the lunch line in school, and a boy ahead of me discovered he didn't have money for lunch. I didn't know him, but I offered to buy him lunch, and he become one of my best friends. This taught me to give first before I've received anything from someone, and just see what happens.</div></div>


<div class="rev-act"><div class="rev-act-header">Revolutionary Activity #6<br/>Discover your own sacred gifts</div>
<div class="rev-act-body">Did you know that each person -- including you -- has sacred gifts to share? There are many ways to find them. 1) You could take time alone without distraction and feel in your heart what most matters to you, and how you can act in service of it. 2) Ask yourself what would be the most meaningful life you could imagine. 3) Notice what brings you special joy and or sparks curiosity, and build on those things. 4) Ask people around you when they have noticed you being the most joyful, enlivened, and engaged in life. 5) Notice what you feel angry about. Your anger can show you what you care about, or an injustice you want to make right.<br/><br/>If you do not get a clear answer quickly, have patience and keep asking these questions over time.</div></div>


<div class="rev-act"><div class="rev-act-header">Revolutionary Activity #7<br/>Join or create a sharing group</div>
<div class="rev-act-body">Imagining nation-wide generosity can be hard in unhealthy cultures, but we each have the ability to make generosity normal all around us. One way is to invite your friends together to found a _sharing group_. Find a way for the group to serve each of the individuals. For example, each month the group may travel to one person's home and help with home maintenance and gardening. Often the recipient will cook a big meal for everyone to celebrate after a long day. Another example: consider creating a fund to which each person contributes $100/month, which your group can give or lend to anybody who needs help. Get creative and have fun thinking of how your sharing group can act generously towards each other or a meaningful cause.</div></div>


<div class="rev-act"><div class="rev-act-header">Revolutionary Activity #8<br/>Practice standing for what's right</div>
<div class="rev-act-body">When you act on your urge to stand for what's right, you bring justice, connection, and understanding into the world. Think about a time you saw someone disrespected, misunderstood, cheated, or attacked, whether on TV or in person. How did you respond? How could you have taken a stand to make the situation turn out better? Look for another instance where someone around you is disrespected, and find a way to help address the disrespect so it doesn't happen again.</div></div>


<div class="rev-act"><div class="rev-act-header">Revolutionary Activity #9<br/>Support someone else when they take a stand</div>
<div class="rev-act-body">The mirror-woman showed integrity by standing for the values that she wanted in her culture. Consider: how much harder would it have been for her to take that stand if she didn't trust that others would stand with her if she were attacked? In other words, how much easier was it for her to take a stand knowing that others would support her?<br/><br/>Think of a time when you wanted to take a stand in some way -- perhaps because a bully was picking on someone, or a boss made a rude remark in public, or a teacher was rude to a student, or a company was polluting the Earth. Were you scared to speak up and confront them because you worried you'd be alone? How amazing would it feel knowing you could take a stand and you could trust others to support you?<br/><br/>Just like you would want others' support in difficult moments, they want yours too. Your support makes it easier for other people to act with integrity. Look for an opportunity to support someone else who "sticks their neck out" to do the right thing, even when it's unpopular.</div></div>


<div class="rev-act"><div class="rev-act-header">Revolutionary Activity #10<br/>Notice when you hold back out of fear</div>
<div class="rev-act-body">Everyone has an urge to stand for what's right, but many learn to hold back out of fear -- fear of losing friends, angering a spouse, losing their job, or getting punished. To cultivate your spiritual strength, it helps to notice when you feel afraid and when you hold back out of fear.<br/><br/>Think of a time when you felt an urge to do a good deed or speak out or stand up for someone else, but you held back. What were you afraid of? Are you proud of your choice? If not, how could you find the bravery in yourself to show up differently in the future?</div></div>


<div class="rev-act"><div class="rev-act-header">Revolutionary Activity #11<br/>Channel your anger</div>
<div class="rev-act-body">How do you feel reading about such profound corruption in the "justice system"? How do you feel knowing that, since you live in an unfree, unhealthy culture, you would be punished if you confronted any legal authorities to seek real justice for the prisoners?<br/><br/>If you feel anger or other difficult feelings reading about this, that's ok. The energy behind those feelings is a gift; it's the energy that can motivate you to help stand for real justice. Remember that you're not alone, and plenty of other people want justice just like you. Find a productive way to channel that energy, such as by confronting injustices where you live, educating others, or helping found a new healthy culture where people would never tolerate such abuses.</div></div>


<div class="rev-act"><div class="rev-act-header">Revolutionary Activity #12<br/>Choose what lessons you learn</div>
<div class="rev-act-body">You have the power to choose what perspectives to learn from others, and which to ignore. Think back to your childhood, and reflect on the beliefs and attitudes you were taught, whether from capitalism, a religion, or anything else. Think of a helpful insight or wisdom that you would like to keep in your life, and think of something hurtful or superficial from that belief system that you do not want to keep.</div></div>


<div class="rev-act"><div class="rev-act-header">Revolutionary Activity #13<br/>Protect yourself from adopting racist or hateful beliefs</div>
<div class="rev-act-body">When all you hear are terrible stories about a country or ethnicity, it can be hard to remember that they're just people too. But if you knew someone from that group that you admired, you're much less likely to fall for manipulative racist and hateful propaganda.<br/><br/>Think of a country or ethnicity that your government or news media commonly report in very negative ways. Then find a person from there that you can admire or learn from. You could try to meet someone who lives nearby, or if you cannot find anyone, go to the library and look for stories there. If you live in the United States, I suggest finding someone from Russia, Iran or Palestine.<br/><br/>For example, Vasily Arkhipov was a Russian naval officer working in a Soviet submarine during the Cuban Missile Crisis. One day during that tense standoff with the US in 1962, the two most senior officers wanted to launch nuclear weapons, falsely thinking that war had broken out after an American ship dropped explosives near their sub. All 3 top officers had to agree in order to fire the nuclear weapons, but Arkhipov, the most junior of the three officers, did not believe war had broken out, did not bow to pressure, and refused to launch nuclear weapons. He was right, war had not begun, and his integrity under pressure prevented global nuclear war and saved the lives of countless people.<br/><br/>Finding a person to learn from does not mean you need to support any of these countries' governments. But if you're ever tempted to feel racism or hatred towards a whole country or group, the admirable person you find will remind you that they're just people too, probably stuck in an unhealthy culture like you.</div></div>


<div class="rev-act"><div class="rev-act-header">Revolutionary Activity #14<br/>Spread good news to encourage good deeds</div>
<div class="rev-act-body">You have the power to encourage good deeds and even help the most humble people become leaders. One key way is to notice others' good deeds, and retell those stories. What good deeds have you witnessed recently? And to whom could you share these happy stories?</div></div>


<div class="rev-act"><div class="rev-act-header">Revolutionary Activity #15<br/>Cultivate awareness and connection with the living world</div>
<div class="rev-act-body">No matter how much or little you know, the same basic practices can help you cultivate awareness and connection with the living world. Find a place within 15 minutes of your house where you can observe the wildlife -- a place you like to be. Go there every day, practice feeling gratitude for the nonhumans' gifts, and observe what's going on.<br/><br/>What trails do you see? What birds live there, and what are their lives like? Consider what desires and fears each animal or plant has, what relationships they have with each other, and what lessons they have to teach from how they live their lives. _I strongly recommend looking for a nature connection mentor or program to help you on your path._</div></div>


<div class="rev-act"><div class="rev-act-header">Revolutionary Activity #16<br/>Learn to judge when violence is appropriate</div>
<div class="rev-act-body">Each person can have the strength to judge when violence is appropriate and when it's not. Think of 3 examples of selfish violence and selfless violence in service of a greater good. If necessary, do research to find three of each kind. What do the examples of selfish violence have in common? What do your examples of selfless violence have in common? In what circumstances do you think violence is appropriate, and when is it not appropriate?</div></div>


<div class="rev-act"><div class="rev-act-header">Revolutionary Activity #17<br/>Find people with whom you can speak your heart**</div>
<div class="rev-act-body">Even if you don't know how to respond to your feelings, it can be extremely helpful to have thoughtful, trustworthy people to speak your heart to. If you don't know anybody you trust this much, look for new friends. Your future friends are out there, and they'll be glad to meet you. If you already have friends you trust, invite them to conversations so you can share whatever is in your heart, and likewise listen to them.</div></div>


<div class="rev-act"><div class="rev-act-header">Revolutionary Activity #18<br/>Release What Isn't Working</div>
<div class="rev-act-body">Reflect on your life, and think of one belief you have that isn't working. Do you keep voting, hoping someday the government won't be corrupt? Do you believe people are inclined to sin or that obedience is good or have shame about your body, and so you have self-doubt or low self-worth? Do you think rich people are better than poor, and you judge people by how much money they have instead of how much they serve the people around them? Do you believe other people are basically untrustworthy, and so you struggle to form many deeply trusting relationships?<br/><br/>Take some time and think of a belief or attitude that hasn't served you, and embrace one that might serve you better.</div></div>


<div class="rev-act"><div class="rev-act-header">Revolutionary Activity #19<br/>Learn to receive the tangible gifts of the Earth</div>
<div class="rev-act-body">Have you ever felt curious to learn how to navigate by starlight, or eat wild foods? Or build a house of natural materials, or make fire by rubbing sticks together? Situational awareness, nutrition, housing, and fire are all examples of the endless gifts that the Earth can provide if you learn how to receive them with gratitude.<br/><br/>Notice any curiosity you've felt about some aspect of the nonhuman world, even going back to your childhood. Whatever it is, follow that curiosity. Learn how to make the fire, or forage local foods, or wherever your curiosity guides you so that you begin to receive the gifts of the Earth.</div></div>


<div class="rev-act"><div class="rev-act-header">Revolutionary Activity #20<br/>Cultivate gratitude for Earth's intangible gifts</div>
<div class="rev-act-body">Have you gone on a walk to get fresh air and clear your head? Or gone to the woods for private time away from people?<br/><br/>When I practice noticing gifts I receive and giving thanks, I often feel most grateful for intangible gifts. I'm grateful to forests for giving privacy when I want alone time, or private time with friends. I'm grateful to the birds for their songs that lift my spirit in the morning, and grateful to the moon for its enchanting light. When I imagine life without any trees or birds or the moon, it's easy to think how poorer that life would be, and it's easy to feel grateful for their gifts.<br/><br/>Think of an intangible gift you receive from the Earth, whether from plants or animals or streams or anything else, and practice noticing and feeling grateful for it.</div></div>


<div class="rev-act"><div class="rev-act-header">Revolutionary Activity #21<br/>Practice the same gratitude with people</div>
<div class="rev-act-body">What tangible and intangible gifts do you receive from people around you? Is there a child whose smile lifts your spirits, or an older friend who has mentored you? Have family members helped you pay for school, or friends supported you during a difficult time during a relationship? Notice the gifts you receive and feel grateful for them. Where appropriate, express your gratitude to the people directly so they know the impact they had on you.</div></div>


<div class="rev-act"><div class="rev-act-header">Revolutionary Activity #22<br/>Make time to discover your sacred gifts, or your most meaningful path</div>
<div class="rev-act-body">Choose a time in the near future when you can avoid all distractions and feel into your heart to sense what most matters to you, or how you could give your deepest love. Practice listening with gratitude, as you don't choose your sacred gifts -- they choose you.<br/><br/>If you do not get a clear answer quickly, have patience and keep listening.</div></div>
