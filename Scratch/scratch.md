### Chapter ending

In cultures where everyone embraces this practice of gracious receiving, where people retell stories of others' good deeds, they wind up with leaders who don't spread racism and hatred. So many problems, including racism, hatred, sexism, pollution, poverty in the midst of abundance, disconnection from nature, corruption, greed, child abuse, and more are _symptoms of the root cultural disease where a few people rule over the rest, and people accept their own obedience as legitimate_. Any culture with this disease will show these symptoms, each in its own way. And I believe a single cure could end all these terrible troubles: creating cultures where everyone stands for what's right, and no one rules over anyone else.

### Bible-Childbirth

Authoritarian religions often blame the victims for their own suffering instead of acknowledging the abuses imposed by the ruling class. The Christian Bible and Jewish Torah claim, in Genesis 3:16, that God condemned women forever because the "original" woman Eve tempted a man to eat forbidden fruit, saying "I [God] will make your pains in childbearing very severe; with painful labor you will give birth to children."

The Book of Genesis is an allegory for ancient Jews' transition from a healthy culture to an unhealthy culture. In the "Garden of Eden" they had no shame of their naked bodies and paid careful attention to the plants and animals. After God "expelled" them from the Garden, their lives were primarily shaped by abusive authorities and all the usual troubles followed: body shame, sexism, extra hard work to pay taxes to the ruling class, and much more. 

It turns out that the vast majority of Jewish and Christian women began suffering more-difficult childbirths after this period, but not because of God.

Many observers have noticed that women in healthy cultures commonly have relatively easy childbirths. Weston Price visited healthy cultures around the world in the 1900s and noticed "With several of these tribes... the ease with which childbirth is accomplished is so great that it is looked upon as quite an insignificant experience." Bartolome De Las Casas remarked on the Arawaks, "pregnant women work to the last minute and give birth almost painlessly; up the next day, they bathe in the river and are as clean and healthy as before giving birth..."

Why might childbirth be easier for women in healthy cultures? Research shows that women struggle to eat high-nutrition diets in unhealthy cultures where ruling classes force so many people into poverty. The Bible and Torah claim that God says that women deserve difficult childbirths, when the reality is that unnecessarily difficult childbirths in unhealthy cultures clearly stem from widespread nutritional deficiencies which are common when so many people live in poverty. In other words, difficult childbirths stem from oppression imposed by rulers, not due to "God's" wrath towards women due to the first woman's disobedience. But you wouldn't learn that from the Bible or Torah would you?

### Decision-making based on reciprocity

Okanagan Jeannette Armstrong grew up in British Columbia, Canada. She described the en’owkinwiwx collective decision-making process which explicitly includes several components: minority views, the land, human relationships, and creativity. She said that “the minority voice is the most important voice to consider… [it] expresses the things that are going wrong… if you ignore this minority voice it will create conflict in your community and this conflict is going to create a breakdown… This conflict will endanger… how we think of ourselves as a cooperative unit…, a unit that knows how to work together… and loves one another.”

Armstrong described how she was brought up as a land speaker, someone trained to speak on behalf of the land in their councils. They also have speakers for children, mothers, elders, water, and others. Armstrong described how she was “trained by my Elders to think about the land and to speak about the land.” She does not represent people or consider herself an expert. Instead, “[I] must continuously be responsible to my community.” Every time the community considers a decision, no matter how small, “my responsibility is to stand up and ask, How will it impact the land… our food… our water? How is it going to impact my children, my grandchildren, my great-grandchildren, what’s the land going to look like in their time?”

When a community includes the perspectives of human relationships and the land in their decision-making, “community changes… the material things don’t have a lot of meaning… material wealth and the securing of it or being fearful and being frightened about not having ‘things’ to sustain you, disappears… The realization that people and community are there to sustain you creates the most secure feeling in the world… When that happens, you’re imbued with the hope that others surrounding you in your community can provide.”






## Chapter 9: Gift Economies

When I first read Mohawk writers describe their traditional way of life as "a kind of utopia," I was skeptical.[xxx-a basic call to consciousness|p104] After all, I had been told my whole life that utopias don't exist. The Encyclopedia Britannica even says, "utopian and utopianism are words used to denote visionary reform that tends to be impossibly idealistic."[xxx-britannica utopia]

But I kept reading and hearing about healthy cultures where sharing is a normal way of life, or was normal in the past when the people could live in a fully traditional way.

Nancy Basket summarized the traditional Cherokee culture of sharing this way: "If we all had a lot, then everybody had a lot. If there wasn't a whole lot, then no one had a whole lot."[xxx-basket interview]

Sioux man Ohiyesa wrote, "During the summer, when Nature is at her best, and provides abundantly for the [native], it seems to me that no life is happier than his! Food is free -- lodging free -- everything free! All were alike rich in the summer, and, again, all were alike poor in the winter and early spring."[xxx-indian child life|early hardships]

These descriptions might have sounded too good to be true if I hadn't spent time with the Ashaninka and experienced this kind of deep sharing myself. Every time I found myself questioning these stories, I remembered back to my time with the Ashaninka and remembered that people really can live together in a way where sharing is the norm.

What is it like when an entire society embraces a _gift economy_ where things are shared as needed, and what cultural practices help maintain such an economy so that people can continually generate and share abundance?

### Gift Economies and Indian Givers

One of my earliest childhood memories involves giving somebody a gift and noticing that they didn't use it. When I tried to take it back, I was called an "indian giver." I was told that to be a generous gift-giver, I was supposed to release all interest in what happens to my gift after I give it. I was told that the gift becomes someone else's property and therefore is no longer any of my business.

Not wanting the scorn I associated with being called an indian giver, that's how I learned to give gifts -- first it belonged to me, and now it belongs to someone else.  It took decades for me to learn that this attitude towards sharing is rooted in private property ownership and essential to maintaining authoritarian cultures. I was amazed to learn that my early childhood self had the healthier attitude to gift-giving!

All of life is simply divine beings giving their gifts. This is the recognition behind the first core spiritual practice of cultivating the practical, aware gratitude for the gifts of life. Chestnut trees give tasty chestnuts, stinging nettle plants heal joint pain, stars provide guidance, and the soil accepts us back and recycles us after we die. All these beings give divine gifts that make life possible and beautiful. No one makes them do this. Humans play their role by giving their own sacred gifts too -- the second core spiritual practice.

In gift economies, people simply figure out where gifts are most needed or valued, and everyone helps circulate gifts until they get to that highest use. This is where the derogatory phrase "indian giver" comes from: people of North American healthy cultures (known as indians) often gave gifts to European colonists, noticed they weren't being used, and then asked for them back so the gifts could be given elsewhere. European colonists, who were used to private property ownership where giving a gift gave another person the right to do whatever they want with it, thus saw "indian giving" as a violation of their private property rights.[xxx-braiding sweetgrass|the gift of strawberries]

Nancy Basket described how the Cherokee would commonly ensure gifts got where they were needed, and how European colonists misunderstood this: "We would know each other well enough to see what they might need. And if we would give somebody a gift and they didn't use it, we would be embarrassed. And we would either take it back or something else because it wasn't being used. She didn't need it. And people called us Indian givers for that."[xxx-basket interview]

"Indian giver" became a negative label, describing someone who gave a gift and now selfishly wants it back. In reality, an "indian giver" is behaving thoughtfully, paying attention to whether the gift is needed. If the gift goes unused, the so-called indian giver exerts extra effort to retrieve the unused gift and pass it along to someone else who needs it more.

Due to this fundamental difference between caring for others and caring primarily for oneself, the contrast between these two economies is striking. Gift-economy practices can seem offensive to people in profit economies, and profit-economy practices can seem offensive to people in gift economies.

A person in a gift economy may feel upset if a person accepts a gift, doesn't use it, and then selfishly refuses to pass it on to someone else. A person from a profit economy may feel upset if they receive a gift only to find that the giver wants it back. Both sides may feel offended, and it reflects a fundamentally different perspective on sharing (focusing on others) and hoarding (focusing on oneself). Do gifts keep moving until they arrive where they are most needed? Or do people hoard possessions whether they need them or not?

Potawatomi woman Robin Kimmerer noted the consequences when she wrote, "If all the world is a commodity, how poor we grow. When all the world is a gift in motion, how wealthy we become."[xxx-braiding sweetgrass|the gift of strawberries]

This healthy-culture attitude to gift-giving stems from the deep recognition that all of life is simply the giving of divine gifts. Every spider, bear, bush, and cloud is giving its sacred gifts and somehow contributing to the web of life. Who would want to stop all that giving? Gift economies aim to circulate gifts rather than hoard them, and this kind of human economy fits in well with the larger nonhuman economy of all life.

Gift economies also have many practical benefits. They move resources from the haves to the have-nots, minimizing inequality. Gift economies ensure neighbors take care of each other. People might suffer poverty together occasionally, but nobody suffers poverty alone while others have abundance. Gift economies help people take care of each other whenever the group faces a big challenge.

### Private Property Rights vs Sacred Responsibilities

Robin Kimmerer described the gift-economy and profit-economy views of gifts. In an economy focused on private profit, people commonly think of a gift as free because they don't pay for it. But in a gift economy, _a gift is not free_. Instead, Kimmerer said, "The essence of the gift is that it creates a set of relationships. The currency of a gift economy is, at its root, reciprocity." Cultures that view private property as a collection of rights miss out on this essence of a gift as a collection of responsibilities.

If I am in a culture where hoarding is the norm, I could easily feel the need to hoard too. If I don't hoard when I have extra, how will I ensure I have enough during lean times? In profit-economies, many people carefully guard their possessions as well as the private property rights those possessions entail. In profit economies, individuals can easily fear poverty, and for many, the clearest way to avoid it is to acquire wealth through profitable work and hoard the savings. This is one way profit economies motivate selfish behavior.

Profit economies also motivate people to care about their private property rights. If someone else can influence how I use my possessions, how can I be sure I'll be able to use them when I'm in need?

This illustrates why, in profit economies, gifts and property ownership are associated with a set of rights, and many property owners jealously guard those rights. On the other hand, in gift economies, _gifts are associated with a set of responsibilities_.

One responsibility is to ensure the gift goes to the highest good. For example, a group can honor food by ensuring it goes to the hungriest person. A hungry person honors an apple much more than someone who throws it in the compost because their belly is already full.

Anyone who receives a gift also has a responsibility to the giver, and this stems from that third core spiritual practice, living in reciprocity. I get to give back to the people and nonhumans who give to me.

One aspect of this responsibility is to honor the gift, and one way to honor the gift is to make sure it goes to where it's most needed. Another way to honor the gift is to only take what is needed so that nothing is wasted. If I am collecting vines to make a basket, I make the basket only as big as I need, and I only collect the amount of vines required to make the basket.

Another aspect of responsibility is to serve the giver. If I take an apple from a tree, I am responsible for taking care of the apple tree. I might do this by watering or pruning it.  If I kill a deer, I am responsible for taking care of the deer's family. I might do this by protecting the deers' habitat, protecting deer from disrespectful poachers, or educating others about respectful hunting. If I take water from a stream, I'm responsible for helping take care of the stream. I could honor the stream by protecting it from pollution or erosion.

When I take the apple, deer meat, and stream water, I enter into a relationship with those beings. In spiritual terms, I get to take care of the beings who take care of me, otherwise someday they may stop giving their gifts. In ecological terms, I need to protect the beings whom I choose to depend upon, or else someday the food and water may no longer be there.

These spiritual attitudes underlying the gift economy are not about creating poverty by ignoring one's own needs. These attitudes generate abundance by training people to act in ways that allow everyone in the culture to meet their needs indefinitely, generation after generation.

When Europeans arrived on the North American east coast several centuries ago, they did not find forests full of tangled brush. They found forests they described as "open, park-like woods," which would have made it easy for deer to get around. Various North American groups had been using carefully controlled forest fires to tend the forest and grasslands for centuries.[xxx-1491|fire place]

One of the most common trees in eastern North America was the American Chestnut. The chestnut was once so abundant and its late-spring white flowers so thick in the forest canopy, people said it looked like the mountains were covered in snow in June.[xxx-sierra club snow chestnut] Many people of North American healthy cultures had tended the forest to encourage supportive habitats for animals and fruit and nut trees.[xxx-1491|rise and fall of the american bottom]

The same fruit and nut trees that fed humans also fed animals like deer, bear, and bison which humans could hunt. This deep spiritual practice of living in reciprocity with the Earth meant that humans generated abundance that spanned countless generations. Humans honored the nonhumans who gave so many gifts in part by protecting and enriching those nonhumans' habitats, which caused them to give even more gifts.

In ecological terms, when humans increased deer habitat, the deer population grew, increasing the number of deer that humans could hunt without overhunting. This was also true for the bear, bison, fish, and other beings humans depended upon. The human gift economy interacted with the larger non-human gift economy to generate tremendous abundance for all beings.

This shows how taking care of ourselves and taking care of the Earth are the same thing. When humans don't survive by working for bosses to make money, and instead serve the nonhumans they depend upon, they protect themselves from lean times by sharing abundance rather than hoarding.

The opposite of selfishness doesn't have to mean selflessly ignoring one's own needs. The opposite of selfishness can also mean ensuring that everybody's needs get met, humans and nonhumans alike. "Ensuring that everyone's needs get met" is also a good definition of solidarity.

When the Potawatomi, Cherokee, and other healthy culture people lived in their traditional gift economies, this was the practical and spiritual result: they generated incredible abundance. And this explains why they strongly encouraged sharing and heavily discouraged selfishness, even going so far as banishing or killing people who repeatedly insisted on behaving selfishly and showed no willingness to change, as explored in Chapter 4. Tolerating selfishness would have threatened the entire human and nonhuman gift economy. When allowed to fester, selfishness destroys abundance.

The different perspectives underlying gift economies and profit economies explain why so many European colonial traders were called selfish and greedy by the healthy-culture people they encountered. James Adair, a trader in southeast North America in the 1700s, noticed this and wrote, "they say we are covetous, because we do not give our poor relations such a share of our possessions as would keep them from want. There are but few of themselves we can blame on account of these crimes, for they are very kind and liberal to every one of their own tribe, even to the last morsel of food they enjoy."[xxx-illustrated native american|p236]

Even after my time with the Ashaninka, I still struggle to imagine living in a culture that protects everyone and generates such abundance. When sharing is the norm, everyone can routinely feel safe, as neighbors commonly support each other through difficult times. And this feeling of shared abundance and security motivates deep generosity.

When a gift economy forms and everybody trusts everybody else to share, magic happens. Okanagan Jeannette Armstrong described this magic when people make decisions taking both the land and human relationships into account. I believe she was also describing life in a gift economy when she said, "Something happens inside where the material things don't have a lot of meaning, where material wealth and the securing of it or being fearful and being frightened about not having 'things' to sustain you, disappears." She called it "_the most secure feeling in the world_."[xxx-original instructions|armstrong]

This deep security enables people to find a freedom that is chronically elusive in unhealthy cultures. Ohiyesa described how "Our great men not only divided their last kettle of food with a neighbor, but if great grief should come to them, such as the death of child or wife, they would voluntarily give away their few possessions and begin life over again in token of their sorrow." Unhealthy cultures that encourage fearful hoarding make it difficult to respond to a personal tragedy through deliberately giving up everything and rebuilding a new life of abundance.[xxx-from deep woods to civilization|civ preached practiced]

I believe that this freedom that comes from "the most secure feeling in the world" is the result of living in a gift economy rooted in the three core spiritual practices: cultivating a practical, aware gratitude for all the gifts I receive, giving my own gifts fully, and living in reciprocity.

This also clarifies how humans can be part of nature and why so many things are called unnatural. For example, coal mines, clear-cut forests, and toxic chemicals are all generally considered unnatural. Human behavior is only unnatural when people act selfishly without taking the needs of the Earth into account. When fishers scour the ocean floor for every last fish, developers pave new roads, or cities pile up trash in landfills, these are only unnatural because the people aren't acting with the needs of the land in mind. Selfish behavior is unnatural.

Acting with generosity towards the Earth and building up abundance is what it means for humans to be part of nature. This explains why Western Shoshone man Corbin Harney said, "native people are not separate from the environment. We are the environment!"[xxx-original instructions|we are the environment]

What makes people of healthy cultures part of the environment? They are part of the environment because they take nonhumans' needs -- the needs of animals, plants, insects, water, soil, air, and more -- into account in everything they do. Caring for all life and caring for my life is the same because I am a part of all life.

This taught me how anyone of any culture can choose to be part of their environment or part of nature: _take the nonhumans' needs into account in everything you do_.

### Stories of Sharing

Stories of deep sharing permeate the writings of European colonists as well as people of healthy cultures describing their way of life.

Jesuit Christian missionaries noted that the Huron would never let someone go without food or shelter. When someone's house burned down in the Huron village Ossossane, their neighbors came together to build them a new one. They did not have markets for trading or bartering, but instead embraced hospitality, gift-giving, and ceremonial exchanges. Visitors to a village were given food and shelter for as long as they wished to stay.[xxx-huron farmers of the north|p40]

The Huron would publicly announce whenever someone donated a large amount towards a feast, funeral, or ceremony, and this raised the donor's status. People thus enjoyed accumulating goods so that they could give away as much as possible, and thus earn their neighbors' gratitude. Feasts were common as people sought to build up their stash of food only to give it away.[xxx-huron farmers of the north|p93]

The Sioux commonly modeled deep giving for their children. They would host feasts to celebrate every accomplishment. Ohiyesa wrote, "[Crazy Horse] was carefully brought up according to the tribal customs. At that period the Sioux prided themselves on the training and development of their sons and daughters, and not a step in that development was overlooked as an excuse to bring the child before the public by giving a feast in its honor. At such times the parents often gave so generously to the needy that they almost impoverished themselves, thus setting an example to the child of self-denial for the general good. His first step alone, the first word spoken, first game killed, the attainment of manhood or womanhood, each was the occasion of a feast and dance in his honor, at which the poor always benefited to the full extent of the parents' ability."[xxx-indian heroes and great chieftains|crazy horse] When a couple was courting, their parents would celebrate this with feasts and gifts for those who had little.[xxx-indian heroes and great chieftains|two strike]

Ohiyesa described how parents intentionally raised children to give: "It was our belief that the love of possessions is a weakness to be overcome. Its appeal is to the material part, and if allowed its way it will in time disturb the spiritual balance of the man. Therefore the child must early learn the beauty of generosity. He is taught to give what he prizes most, and that he may taste the happiness of giving, he is made at an early age the family almoner. If a child is inclined to be grasping, or to cling to any of his little possessions, legends are related to him, telling of the contempt and disgrace falling upon the ungenerous and mean man."[xxx-soul of the indian|barbarism and the moral code]

Crazy Horse's mother demonstrated such mentoring. When Crazy Horse was four or five years old, the band faced a severe winter, and hunters struggled to get food. His diligent father finally killed two antelopes, and the little boy promptly got on his pony and rode around inviting all the old people to come get meat.

Neither his mother nor his father had authorized this! Soon a long line formed, and by the end the mother only had enough meat for two meals. The next day, hungry young Crazy Horse asked for food, and his mother told him the old people had taken it. She said, "Remember, my son, they went home singing praises in your name, not my name or your father's. You must be brave. You must live up to your reputation." Instead of punishing her son, Crazy Horse's mother invited him to remember he had done a good thing and bravely face the consequences even if he had to suffer a little for it.[xxx-indian heroes and great chieftains|crazy horse]

The Sioux intentionally trained their children to be brave, and one reason was that brave children would be willing to share instead of acting selfishly out of fear. This brave generosity was commonly publicly acknowledged and rewarded even in adulthood. For example, each year in June, Black Elk's village held a sun dance, and they would select a warrior who had recently shown special bravery. After playing a role in the ceremony, Black Elk described what came next: "he had to give gifts to those who had least of everything, and the braver he was, the more he gave away..." They raised the status of a specially brave warrior by giving him a special ceremonial role, and then allowed him to raise his status further by giving away many things to people in need. Abundance begets abundance.[xxx-black elk speaks|fight with three stars]

I believe that helping to redistribute resources is a core leadership role in healthy cultures. Martín Prechtel described how the Tzutujil Mayans had a "self-impoverished theocracy" where people "loved to get more than someone else, just so they could dress fancily and give it all away to be big." Prechtel wrote how the Tzutujil Mayans became leaders: "To get anywhere in traditional Mayan society, you had to work really hard to get wealth, get appointed to office without campaigning, and then give it all away." Each time a leader rose to a new level in their hierarchy, he or she gave away all their things so that they were equally as impoverished as everyone else.[xxx-secrets of the talking jaguar|p210]

### How can Gift Economies Generate a Deep Sense of Security?

Prechtel hinted at the deep sense of security the Tzutujil Mayans felt in their traditional culture: not only did they not have locks on their houses, they didn't have doors. Their language didn't even have a word for door![xxx-secrets of the talking jaguar|p276]

Many visitors to healthy cultures have remarked on the lack of police and prisons in societies that maintain a gift economy.

I certainly saw no police or prisons when I stayed with the Ashaninka. In the early 1600s, French Christian missionaries traveled to North America and stayed with the Huron. They were very puzzled that the Huron had leaders, and the people followed rules, and yet there were no police, no prisons, and no capital punishment, all of which they considered essential to French society.[xxx-huron farmers of the north|p71] Weston Price was an American dentist who studied healthy cultures around the world in the early 1900s, and he wrote that "few impressions can be more vivid than that of the absence of prisons and asylums." In contrast, he described how "serious and disturbing" it was in unhealthy cultures to see a widespread "increase in the percentage of individuals with unsocial traits."[xxx-nutr phys gen|phys ment moral deter]

American Benjamin Franklin observed healthy cultures in eastern North America in the 1700s, and he noted the lack of prisons and police as well when he wrote, "All their government is by Counsel of the Sages. There is no Force; there are no Prisons, no officers to compel Obedience, or inflict Punishment."[xxx-lies my teacher told me|p108]

Generosity and selfishness do not mix well. When two generous people share with each other, the sharing can continue forever. When a generous person shares with a selfish person, the selfish person will keep taking until the generous person has nothing left, or until the generous person decides to protect themselves -- either way, the sharing stops.

I consistently find that people of healthy cultures recognize selfishness itself as something to address so that everyone feels comfortable sharing with others in their society. Once I realized that these societies quickly address selfishness so that generosity remains the norm, it became clear why gift economies could feel so secure.

When an entire community enriches the Earth, the Earth can be a growing source of abundance. And when a gift economy moves resources where they're needed, no one needs to fear the twin challenge of having nothing and having no help in dealing with it.

Even catastrophes are only as bad as they truly need to be. For example, when a Huron house burned down in Ossossane, the house and some items were lost but there wasn't much suffering beyond that because neighbors shared their food and helped build a new home.[xxx-huron farmers of the north|p40] A culture of sharing makes it safe to not have very much, and it makes it safe to not hoard to protect oneself from every potential future risk.

Gift economies also make it safe to work only as much as needed. Nobody's livelihood depends on anybody else's suffering or wastefulness. This was obvious in the words of one Arikara man to a Canadian trader named Pierre-Antoine Tabeau: "Why do you wish to make all this powder and these balls since you do not hunt? Of what use are all these knives to you? Is not one enough with which to cut the meat? It is only your wicked heart that prevents you from giving them to us. Do you not see that the village has none? I will give you a robe myself, when you want it, but you already have more robes than are necessary to cover you." The trader noted, "their minds not grasping our ideas of interest and acquisition beyond what is necessary, it is a principle with them that he who has divides with him who has not."[xxx-illustrated native american|p231]

The trader kept things he didn't need so that he could sell them, and he likewise benefited when people bought more of his products than they really needed. Reflecting on the Arikaras' culture of sharing, he wondered how he could "hope for success in a nation, imbued with these principles and always destitute of everything." He could not recognize that these people only had as much as they needed to live a satisfactory life. They did not stockpile things they didn't need just to sell them.

This shows why people of healthy cultures could react so strongly to selfishness: if it took hold, and people without much personal wealth needed to act selfishly to survive, it would make a materially simple life that seemed abundant and secure suddenly seem very insecure. Thus I believe that people in healthy cultures depend on their gift economy of generous sharing. This is not the dependency of a mooch. It is a way of life that only works when everyone participates fully by sharing.

Potawatomi woman Robin Kimmerer explained how anyone in the traditional Potawatomi culture who took too much, to the detriment of the community, was "first counseled, then ostracized, and if the greed continued, they were eventually banished... It is a terrible punishment to be banished from the web of reciprocity, with no one to share with you and no one for you to care for."[xxx-braiding sweetgrass|windigo footprints]

A story from the Huron also showed that some people became very angry with individuals who hoarded food during times when their neighbors were hungry.[xxx-huron farmers of the north|p87]

### When a Nation's Whole Way of Life is Based on the Three Core Spiritual Practices

All these stories showed me what it's like to have an economy based on the three core spiritual practices: a practical aware gratitude for the gifts I receive, giving my own gifts, and living in reciprocity. Healthy cultures around the world all have their unique differences, but all of them have some kind of gift economy that strongly discourages selfishness, instead helping everyone to feel safe sharing generously with their neighbors.

When everyone in an entire nation is trained from birth to give their deepest love every day, without holding back -- which is the second core spiritual practice -- I believe gift economies are the result, where giving and gratitude are the norm rather than profiting. 

All these stories are beautiful, and they made me wonder: what else might be different in a culture where people give their love fully every day without holding back?
