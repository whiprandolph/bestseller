My phone woke me up with an insistent but gentle ringing, much nicer than the rude blaring of the alarm clock I grew up with. Sometimes I get angry at the phone for waking me, but the anger never lasts long because I remember that it could be so much worse.

That always helps me feel better, thinking about what I can feel grateful for and trying to focus on that. I mean, I can't do anything about the need to wake up even when I'm tired -- I have work after all -- and why get upset about something I can't control? The phone is just doing its job after all.

So opened my phone like usual and started scrolling through the news. One pair of celebrities are getting married and many fans seem happy for them, and another pair are divorcing, a big deal with so much money on the line, not to mention two kids. The local school board just voted on a bond sale to raise money for a new building as the student population grew. Didn't I read something similar yesterday? Oh yeah, the county had just borrowed money to build a new prison building too. I guess everything's getting more crowded these days!

After a bagel and coffee, I started my drive to work. Well, not "after" a bagel and coffee because I was late to work and took the bagel remnant with me. I always pass a prison on the way, and this time it reminded me of a little nugget about prisons, one of those little factoids that seems true every I time I double check it, but just doesn't make sense either. The factoid: that 98% of prisoners in the US plea-bargained. Plea bargaining is where prosecutors charge someone with crimes that result in a huge prison time, like 10 or 20 years all the way to 50 or 60 years or life in prison. And then they say: "look, we don't want you to be in prison so long. If you admit that you're guilty, whether you are or not, we'll only makes you stay in prison 5 years. And maybe less with good behavior."

It's a weird factoid, in part because I always think of the courts as places where people present evidence to try and understand the truth. But the vast majority of prisoners never presented their case to a jury; they just got threatened with decades in prison and chose to spend years in prison instead.

I usually don't think about this factoid much, because... why bother? I'm going to work as I drive past, and I'm usually a little late, and I'd rather just relax as much as possible. Every now and then, I drive by and I wonder: how many prisoners actually committed the crimes they were charged with? 20%? 50%? 80%? No one knows, because the vast majority never went to trial. How many of them lied to the judge and said they were guilty when they were actually innocent, just to have a few years in prison instead of decades?

One morning as I drove past the prison, I made a mistake. Usually I'm playing music loudly or smoking to help relax, so I don't think about the prison at all. But when I do think about it, I almost always stop when I wonder how many prisoners are actually guilty. But that one morning, again, I made a mistake -- I kept thinking about the imprisoned people. And then I got angry. Angry that so many people are forced into prisons, away from their kids and spouses, forced to work for pennies or nothing, stuck in a cage most of their waking hours. I got angry about the kids growing up without a parent, or a spouse living without their partner.

It's a confusing anger though. Who am I unhappy with? The guards? the lawyers? Aren't they just doing their job? I knew what I was angry _about_, but I didn't know who to be angry _at_. I never knew what to do with the anger anyway, except ignore it.

This is the worst, getting angry. It really doesn't help me relax on the way to work. When annoying thoughts come up, usually I can get them to go away in a minute or two. But if I get angry about something, that can stress me out my whole day!

The worst is when I get angry about two things on one drive. Then I can't just ignore problem by thinking about whatever else comes up -- because I'm also angry about the whatever else!





Day in the life - woke up, read the news. 


There's this constant inner battle going on in my mind. I don't like feeling stressed out and angry, but I always get that way when I remember. When I remember the prisoners don't actually deserve to be in prison even by the standards of the law, or that a black friend got told to go back to her country when her ancestors were taken away from their land and brought here against their will.



I find it's a lot easier to get through life if I try to ignore what's going on around me. 


If it's legal, it must be ok, and who am I to stop somebody who's doing legal things? And if it's illegal, then it's thte police's job to handle it. Either way, it doesn't do to pay too much attention. Why bother if I'm not going to respond to my angry feelings?
