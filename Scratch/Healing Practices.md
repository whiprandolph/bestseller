# Healing Practices

Below are practices that I associate with healthy cultures, as well as the chapters where they are discussed in this book.

* Three core spiritual practices (practical, aware gratitude; giving one's sacred gifts; and living in reciprocity): _Chapter 3: Healthy Cultures Share Three Core Spiritual Practices_

* Stand for what's right: _Chapter 5: Why Are We So Lost_

* Gracious receiving / Celebrate good deeds: _Chapter 8: Why Are People So Racist And Hateful_

* Violence in service: _Chapter 10: Selfish Violence vs Violence-In-Service_

* Create a new healthy culture: _Chapter 9: Why Don't People Stand Together_ and _Chapter 10: Selfish Violence vs Violence-In-Service_

* Deep generosity: _Chapter 1: This Is Who We Really Are_, _Chapter 2: Healthy Cultures Have Existed for Millions of Years_, _Chapter 4: What If Pervasive Generosity Was Normal?_, _Chapter 6: Why Are People So Selfish?_

* Commit to personal growth

* Hold yourself and others to a high standard

<div class="rev-act-body">One of the biggest causes of self-centeredness is the belief that a person is on their own, and can't trust others to come to their aid in times of need. Think of a friend or family member that you care about, and with whom you already have a mutually nourishing relationship.  and whom you would definitely help in moments of need -- whether they get sick, get in a car accident, get arrested, or lose their job. Find a private moment or invite them to a private conversation, look them in the eye, and tell them you care about them and would support them in moments of need.</div></div>
