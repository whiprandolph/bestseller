* drive by prisons - 98% of inmates didn't have a trial with evidence
* drive by major banks - many employees in that branch are doing their job to provide for their family, while the bank just got busted for money laundering... again
* go to the pharmacy - drug companies producing these just got busted again for fraud that killed a lot of people
* drive past a clear cut forest

* came home and talked to my black female roommate, and she said some white people had told her she ought to go back to where her people came from
* white female friend works as an executive in a regional corporation - sexism common
* kids bored at school / trudging onto a schoolbus at the end of the day

* poorly kept neighborhood - people leaving trash all around, even in their own yard
* perfectly kept middle class neighborhood - prestine, but sometimes walk past a house and hear people yelling inside
* go to restaurant, and I know the cooks are doing their best, but water has been found to contain a variety of toxins such as PFOS/PFAS, food has toxins from pesticides and microplastics, etc.
* And I'm playing my part - driving in car shedding toxins from tires, causing air pollution, and other troubles
* turn on the TV and listen to politicians arguing -- but none of them are addressing these troubles that seem pervasive
* have a lot of friends with children or siblings who have developmental disabilities, including severe mental or emotional handicaps. Then read about toxins in water and wonder if there's a connection.
