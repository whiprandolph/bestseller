### 01 - This is Who We Really Are

<b><div class="rev-act"><div class="rev-act-header">Revolutionary Activity #1<br/>Imagine a whole nation of caring people</div>
</b><div class="rev-act-body">Take 5 minutes to imagine your life if everywhere you went, people welcomed you, fed you, sheltered you, protected you and included you like family. Imagine also if they trusted that you would show the same care for them as a normal way of life. How does that feel?</div></div>



### 02 - Can Whole Nations Embrace Generosity and Integrity

<b><div class="rev-act"><div class="rev-act-header">Revolutionary Activity #2<br/>Did you know?</div>
</b><div class="rev-act-body">Are you surprised to learn that healthy nations have existed for millions of years, including today, where people treat each other with generosity and respect? Did you think that such ways of living are unrealistic? Think of any assumptions you have about people that you may now question.</div></div>



### 03 - Healthy Nations Share Three Core Spiritual Practices

<b><div class="rev-act"><div class="rev-act-header">Revolutionary Activity #3<br/>Gratitude for the nonhumans' gifts</div>
</b><div class="rev-act-body">Cultivating a practical, aware gratitude begins with noticing the gifts you receive. To start, go outside and find a nonhuman to observe closely, and ask what its gifts are.<br/><br/>For example, if you observed a tree, you would ask: how does the tree benefit all the life around it, including you? One way to find out is to ask "what would be different if the tree weren't there?" Does the tree provide nest sites for birds? Does it give you privacy or provide beautiful greenery? Does it hold the soil in place to prevent erosion? Notice all the gifts that you can, and practice feeling grateful for them.</div></div>



<b><div class="rev-act-first"><div class="rev-act-header">Revolutionary Activity #4<br/>Give from gratitude</div>
</b><div class="rev-act-body">Do something kind and no-strings-attached for someone who has done something kind for you, or for anybody who looks like they need help. Get creative with what you can offer, such as helping move heavy things, lifting someone's spirits when they're feeling down, or helping them find a job. Practice feeling gratitude for what they've given you, or if they're a stranger, practice feeling thankful for what other strangers have given you, and give from that place of gratitude. Do not give in exchange or to "pay them back" because this is not a trade. Savor the pleasure of giving just for the joy of it.</div></div>



<b><div class="rev-act-first"><div class="rev-act-header">Revolutionary Activity #5<br/>Discover your own sacred gifts</div>
</b><div class="rev-act-body">You have sacred gifts to share, and there are many ways to find them. Choose one or more of these to help you identify your gifts: 1) Take time alone without distraction and feel in your heart what most matters to you, and how you can act in service of it. 2) Ask yourself what would be the most meaningful life you could imagine. 3) Notice what brings you special joy and or sparks curiosity. 4) Ask your friends when they have noticed you being the most joyful and engaged in life. 5) Notice what you feel angry about. Your anger can show you what you care about, or an injustice you want to make right.<br/><br/>If you do not get a clear answer quickly, have patience and keep investigating over time.</div></div>



### 04 - Imagine If Pervasive Generosity Was Normal

<b><div class="rev-act"><div class="rev-act-header">Revolutionary Activity #6<br/>Join or create a sharing group</div>
</b><div class="rev-act-body">We each have the ability to make generosity normal all around us. One way is to invite your friends together to found a _sharing group._ Find a way for the group to serve each of the individuals. For example, each month the group may travel to one person's home and help with home maintenance and gardening. Often the recipient will cook a big meal for everyone to celebrate after a long day. Another example: create a fund to which each person contributes $100/month, which your group can give or lend to anybody who needs help. Get creative and have fun thinking of how your sharing group can act generously towards each other or serve a meaningful cause.</div></div>



### 06 - Why Are We So Lost

<b><div class="rev-act"><div class="rev-act-header">Revolutionary Activity #7<br/>Stand for what's right</div>
</b><div class="rev-act-body">When you act on your urge to stand for what's right, you bring justice, connection, and understanding into the world. Think about a time you saw someone disrespected, misunderstood, cheated, or attacked, whether on TV or in person. How did you respond? How could you have taken a stand to make the situation turn out better? Look for another instance where someone around you is disrespected, and find a way to help address the disrespect so it doesn't happen again.</div></div>



<b><div class="rev-act"><div class="rev-act-header">Revolutionary Activity #8<br/>Support someone else when they take a stand</div>
</b><div class="rev-act-body">The mirror-woman showed integrity by standing for the values that she wanted in her nation. Consider: how much harder would it have been for her to take that stand if she didn't trust that others would stand with her? In other words, how much easier was it for her to take a stand knowing that she would have others' support?<br/><br/>Think of a time when you wanted to take a stand in some way -- perhaps because a bully was picking on someone, or a boss made a rude remark in public, or a teacher was rude to a student, or a company was polluting the Earth. Were you scared to speak up and confront them because you worried you'd be alone? How amazing would it feel knowing you could take a stand and you could trust others to support you?<br/><br/>Just like you would want others' support in difficult moments, they want yours too. Your support makes it easier for other people to act with integrity. Look for an opportunity to support someone else who "sticks their neck out" to do the right thing, even when it's unpopular.</div></div>



<b><div class="rev-act"><div class="rev-act-header">Revolutionary Activity #9<br/>Notice when you hold back out of fear</div>
</b><div class="rev-act-body">Everyone has an urge to stand for what's right, but many learn to hold back out of fear, such as fear of losing friends, angering a spouse, or losing a job. To cultivate spiritual strength, notice when you feel afraid and hold back.<br/><br/>Recall a time when you felt an urge to do a good deed, speak out, or stand up for someone else, but you held back. What were you afraid of? Next time you feel afraid, notice the fear and find the bravery to do what you need to do.</div></div>



### 07 - Why Are People So Selfish

<b><div class="rev-act-middle"><div class="rev-act-header">Revolutionary Activity #10<br/>Give first</div>
</b><div class="rev-act-body">How can you form new friendships where sharing is the norm? Someone needs to give first to start a relationship of generous reciprocity.<br/><br/>Think of three ways you could give something to a total stranger, not knowing or caring whether or not they would respond generously. It could be simple like holding a door for someone, mentoring a child, or making a nutritious meal for someone who's sick or recovering from childbirth. Without any expectation of return, give to strangers in ways that, even if the relationship ended immediately, it would be ok. Notice which people show gratitude and give back in their own ways over time, and what relationships of reciprocity form.<br/><br/>When I was 12, I was in the lunch line in school, and a boy ahead of me discovered he didn't have money. I didn't know him, but I offered to buy him lunch, and he became one of my best friends. This taught me to give first before I've received anything, and just see what happens.</div></div>



<b><div class="rev-act-last"><div class="rev-act-header">Revolutionary Activity #11<br/>Receive graciously to have reciprocity over time</div>
</b><div class="rev-act-body">Trading and bartering don't involve generosity because they are even exchanges in the moment. When you receive someone's gift and try to make it an equal exchange by giving them something, you're not acknowledging their generosity and allowing your gratitude to grow. You're essentially receiving the object but rejecting the generosity behind it.<br/><br/>Next time someone does something kind for you, just say thanks and enjoy receiving the gift. Whether they're giving you a compliment, making you a meal, or anything else, do not try to give back something of equal value in the moment. Instead, let your feeling of gratitude grow and trust that you'll find ways to give back in reciprocity over time. If you do want to give the other person something, clarify that you're also giving a gift and not making a trade.</div></div>



### 08 - Why Don't More People Stand Together

<b><div class="rev-act"><div class="rev-act-header">Revolutionary Activity #12<br/>Channel your anger</div>
</b><div class="rev-act-body">How do you feel reading about such profound corruption in the "justice system"? How do you feel knowing that, since you live in an unfree, unhealthy nation, you would be punished if you confronted legal authorities to seek real justice for the prisoners?<br/><br/>If you feel anger or other difficult feelings reading about this, that's ok. The energy behind those feelings is a gift; it's the energy that can motivate you to help stand for real justice. Remember that you're not alone, and plenty of people want justice just like you. Find a productive way to channel that energy, such as by confronting injustices where you live, educating others, or helping found a new healthy nation where people would never tolerate such abuses.</div></div>



### 09 - Why Do People Obey Corrupt Leaders

<b><div class="rev-act"><div class="rev-act-header">Revolutionary Activity #13<br/>Choose what lessons you learn</div>
</b><div class="rev-act-body">You have the power to choose which perspectives to learn from others, and which to ignore. Think back to your childhood, and reflect on the beliefs and attitudes you were taught, whether from capitalism, a religion, or anything else. Think of a helpful insight or wisdom that you would like to keep in your life, and think of something hurtful or superficial from that belief system that you do not want to keep.<br/><br/>I grew up as a Christian, and I was taught that Jesus Christ was a good role model. I kept this lesson, and I've learned much about bravery, generosity, and fasting from him. I was also taught that I should be obedient to God and human authorities. But obeying corrupt authorities has never led to justice, so I cultivate integrity and bravery instead of obedience.</div></div>



### 10 - Why Are People So Racist and Hateful

<b><div class="rev-act"><div class="rev-act-header">Revolutionary Activity #14<br/>Protect yourself from adopting racist or hateful beliefs</div>
</b><div class="rev-act-body">When all you hear are terrible stories about a country or ethnicity, it can be hard to remember that they're just people too. But if you know someone from that group that you admire, you're much less likely to fall for manipulative racist and hateful propaganda.<br/><br/>Think of a country or ethnicity that your government or news media commonly report in very negative ways. Then find a person from there that you can admire or learn from. You could try to meet someone who lives nearby, or if you cannot find anyone, look for stories at the library or online. If you live in the United States, I suggest finding someone from Russia, Iran, or Palestine.<br/><br/>For example, Vasily Arkhipov was a Russian naval officer working on a Soviet submarine during the Cuban Missile Crisis. One day during that tense standoff with the US in 1962, the two most senior officers wanted to launch nuclear weapons, falsely thinking that war had broken out after an American ship dropped explosives near their sub. All 3 top officers had to agree in order to fire the nuclear weapons, but Arkhipov, the most junior of the three officers, did not believe war had broken out, did not bow to pressure, and refused to launch nuclear weapons. He was right, war had not begun, and his integrity under pressure prevented global nuclear war and saved the lives of millions of people.[xxx-arkhipov]<br/><br/>Finding a person to learn from does not mean you need to support the country's government. But if you're ever tempted to feel racism or hatred towards a whole country or group, the admirable person you find will remind you that they're people too, probably stuck in an unhealthy nation like you.</div></div>



<b><div class="rev-act"><div class="rev-act-header">Revolutionary Activity #15<br/>Spread good news to encourage good deeds</div>
</b><div class="rev-act-body">You have the power to encourage good deeds and help even the most humble people become leaders. One key way is to notice others' good deeds and retell those stories. Think of a good deed you've witnessed recently, and tell the story so that others know.</div></div>



### 11 - How Can Whole Nations Embrace Awareness and Unity

<b><div class="rev-act"><div class="rev-act-header">Revolutionary Activity #16<br/>Cultivate awareness and connection with the living world</div>
</b><div class="rev-act-body">No matter how much or little you know, the same basic practices can help you cultivate awareness and connection with the living world. Find a place within 15 minutes of your house where you can observe the wildlife -- a place you like to be. Go there every day, practice feeling gratitude for the nonhumans' gifts, and observe what's going on.<br/><br/>What trails do you see? What birds live there, and what are their lives like? Consider what desires and fears each animal or plant has, what relationships they have with each other, and what lessons they have to teach. _I strongly recommend looking for a nature connection mentor or program to help you on your path._</div></div>



### 12 - Selfish Violence vs Selfless Violence

<b><div class="rev-act"><div class="rev-act-header">Revolutionary Activity #17<br/>Judge for yourself when violence is appropriate</div>
</b><div class="rev-act-body">Each person can have the strength to judge when violence is appropriate and when not. Think of 3 examples of selfish violence and selfless violence in service of a greater good. If necessary, do research to find three of each. What do the examples of selfish violence have in common? What do your examples of selfless violence have in common? Decide for yourself when you think violence is appropriate, and when it is not.</div></div>



<b><div class="rev-act"><div class="rev-act-header">Revolutionary Activity #18<br/>Learn self-defense</div>
</b><div class="rev-act-body">Self-defense is the ultimate act of self-respect. Learn how to defend yourself and the people you love from threats and violent attacks.</div></div>



### 13 - Can Whole Nations Embrace High Standards

<b><div class="rev-act"><div class="rev-act-header">Revolutionary Activity #19<br/>Hold yourself and others to a high standard</div>
</b><div class="rev-act-body">Think of a time when someone had faith in you, maybe even more faith than you had in yourself. Did someone help you find the self-respect to leave an abusive relationship? Did a coach help you cultivate the discipline to train at your sport and be the best you could be? Did a teacher help you realize you could be great at whatever you put your mind to? If this mentor did their job properly, they did not shame or punish you, but helped you see your unmet potential and urged you to reach it -- to be your best self, and not settle for less. Think of a time when someone brought out the best in you, holding you to a high standard.<br/><br/>Watch for an instance where someone lets themselves or others down. Perhaps they lie to someone or to themselves, give up on a goal too easily, or tolerate an unsatisfying relationship or job without trying to change it. Help them find the strength to do what they need to do.</div></div>



<b><div class="rev-act"><div class="rev-act-header">Revolutionary Activity #20<br/>Receive feedback graciously by looking for the lesson</div>
</b><div class="rev-act-body">Oftentimes, when one person feels upset by another, they'll struggle to speak clearly and respectfully. Whenever someone expresses frustration with you, or offers you constructive feedback, actively look for the lesson to learn so that you can grow from the experience. Repeat the lesson back to them to ensure both of you agree on it. Make it easy rather than difficult for others to give you constructive feedback.</div></div>



<b><div class="rev-act"><div class="rev-act-header">Revolutionary Activity #21<br/>Hold firm boundaries without encouraging shame or guilt</div>
</b><div class="rev-act-body">Next time someone acts hurtfully towards you or someone you care about, acknowledge the problematic behavior, the impact it had, and what behavior you would rather see. Do not put the other person down or make any hurtful or dismissive comments to them. Trust that they want to know if they made a mistake and will grow from the experience. Many people are not used to being treated this way, with both respect and healthy boundaries, so be ready to help them understand what you expect of them. If they truly are not willing to hold themselves to a high standard, you will see this clearly, and you can decide not to cooperate any more.</div></div>



<b><div class="rev-act"><div class="rev-act-header">Revolutionary Activity #22<br/>Learn without guilt or shame</div>
</b><div class="rev-act-body">Think of a time you made a mistake and you felt guilty or shameful in response, perhaps because an adult urged you to feel this way. How much harder did those feelings make it to learn from your mistake? How helpful would it have been if the person trusted that you wanted to learn from the experience? Next time you make a mistake, learn what you can, notice any feelings of guilt or shame, and just let them go.</div></div>



<b><div class="rev-act"><div class="rev-act-header">Revolutionary Activity #23<br/>Practice bravery</div>
</b><div class="rev-act-body">Consistently facing your fears is one key way to cultivate bravery. Think of a fear that you're avoiding right now. You may have lied and you're afraid to admit it, or you're afraid to quit an unsatisfying job. Face your fear, recognize that you can handle whatever comes, and do what you need to do.</div></div>



### 15 - The Biggest Secret in Human History

<b><div class="rev-act"><div class="rev-act-header">Revolutionary Activity #24<br/>Find people with whom you can speak your heart</div>
</b><div class="rev-act-body">It can be extremely helpful to have thoughtful, trustworthy people to speak your heart to. If you don't know anybody you trust this much, look for new friends. Your future friends are out there, and they'll be glad to meet you. If you have friends you trust, come together so you can share what is in your heart, listen to them, and respond to any concerns together.</div></div>



<b><div class="rev-act"><div class="rev-act-header">Revolutionary Activity #25<br/>Create private spaces</div>
</b><div class="rev-act-body">To really speak your heart with trusted friends, you need privacy. Learn how to create surveillance-free spaces so you can speak with trusted friends with no recording devices present. For example, do experiments with your phone to discover how sensitive the microphone is, and how and where it can be safely stored so you can speak freely.</div></div>



### 16 - Build Your Spiritual Strength

<b><div class="rev-act"><div class="rev-act-header">Revolutionary Activity #26<br/>Release what isn't working</div>
</b><div class="rev-act-body">Reflect on your life, and think of one belief you have that isn't working. Do you keep voting, hoping someday the government won't be corrupt? Do you believe people are inclined to sin or that obedience is good? Do you have shame about your body, and so you have self-doubt or low self-worth? Do you think rich people are better than poor, and you judge people by how much money they have instead of how much they serve the people around them? Do you believe other people are basically untrustworthy, and so you struggle to form deeply trusting relationships?<br/><br/>Take some time and think of a belief or attitude that hasn't served you, and embrace one that might serve you better.</div></div>



<b><div class="rev-act"><div class="rev-act-header">Revolutionary Activity #27<br/>Learn to receive the tangible gifts of the Earth</div>
</b><div class="rev-act-body">Have you ever felt curious to learn how to navigate by starlight, eat wild foods, build a house of natural materials, or make fire by rubbing sticks together? Situational awareness, nutrition, housing, and fire are all examples of the endless gifts that the Earth can provide if you learn how to receive them with gratitude.<br/><br/>Notice any curiosity you've felt about some aspect of the nonhuman world, even going back to your childhood. Whatever it is, follow that curiosity. Learn how to make fire, forage wild foods, or wherever your curiosity guides you so that you begin to receive the gifts of the Earth.</div></div>



<b><div class="rev-act"><div class="rev-act-header">Revolutionary Activity #28<br/>Give thanks for Earth's intangible gifts</div>
</b><div class="rev-act-body">Have you ever gone on a walk to get fresh air and clear your head, or gone to the woods for private time away from people? Have you ever admired the enchanting silver light of the moon at night? Imagine life without any trees or fresh air or the moon, and see how poorer that life would be.<br/><br/>Think of an intangible gift you receive from the Earth, whether from plants or animals or streams or anything else, and practice noticing and feeling grateful for it.</div></div>



<b><div class="rev-act"><div class="rev-act-header">Revolutionary Activity #29<br/>Practice the same gratitude with people</div>
</b><div class="rev-act-body">What tangible and intangible gifts do you receive from people around you? Is there a child whose smile lifts your spirits, or an older friend who has mentored you? Have family members helped you pay for school, or friends supported you during a difficult time in a relationship? Notice the gifts you receive and feel grateful for them. Express your gratitude to the people directly so they know the impact they had on you.</div></div>



<b><div class="rev-act"><div class="rev-act-header">Revolutionary Activity #30<br/>Make time to discover your sacred gifts or your most meaningful path</div>
</b><div class="rev-act-body">Choose a time in the near future when you can avoid all distractions and feel into your heart to sense what most matters to you, or how you could give your deepest love. Practice listening with curiosity, as you don't choose your sacred gifts -- they choose you.<br/><br/>If you do not get a clear answer quickly, have patience.</div></div>



<b><div class="rev-act"><div class="rev-act-header">Revolutionary Activity #31<br/>Make spiritual growth a regular and lifelong practice</div>
</b><div class="rev-act-body">Religions like Christianity and Islam encourage people to gather at least weekly to study their religious teachings as a lifelong practice. Make your spiritual growth likewise a regular, intentional, lifelong practice. Find exercises or opportunities to practice things like bravery, gratitude, joy, integrity, humility, generosity, compassion, and awareness so they become your normal, baseline approach to life. In moments when you need to take a stand for what's right, you'll have the necessary spiritual strength because you practice that strength regularly. The activities in this book can help.</div></div>



### 17 - Build a Healthy Nation One Community at a Time

<b><div class="rev-act"><div class="rev-act-header">Revolutionary Activity #32<br/>Serve the Earth Together</div>
</b><div class="rev-act-body">People can have unity when they all deeply care about the same things. This is part of the magic of the Haudenosaunee's Thanksgiving Address -- among other things, it's a public statement where they remind themselves of their shared gratitude for the Earth, and how important the Earth is to them.<br/><br/>Build unity with others by caring for the Earth together. Whether you're protecting a forest or river from destruction or pollution, or enriching the soil or creating new bird habitat, find a practical way to work with others to give back to the nonhumans who give us humans so much.</div></div>



<b><div class="rev-act"><div class="rev-act-header">Revolutionary Activity #33<br/>Talk clearly about the kind of friendship you want</div>
</b><div class="rev-act-body">Think about what kind of friendships you want. Approach someone with whom you want a strong friendship, and ask if they'd like to discuss the sort of relationship you two could have. Tell them clearly what you want, such as a friendship where each person can rely on the other to tell the truth, to share, and protect and support each other in hard times. Tell them that you're willing to commit to these things -- whatever qualities you choose -- to make this friendship real. Ask them what they want in the friendship and what they will commit to. Find common ground, so you're both excited about the quality of friendship you're committing to have with each other.<br/><br/>When you set clear, high standards and meet them, and help each other grow from mistakes, this creates deep trust faster than just "letting the relationship happen."</div></div>



<b><div class="rev-act"><div class="rev-act-header">Revolutionary Activity #34<br/>What does your path back to grace look like?</div>
</b><div class="rev-act-body">Think of someone who disappointed you recently. Perhaps they lied to you or didn't keep a promise. Decide what words you would need to hear from them, and what actions you would need to see for you to begin trusting them again. Ensure your path back to grace follows the golden rule, so you treat others the way you would want to be treated.</div></div>



<b><div class="rev-act"><div class="rev-act-header">Revolutionary Activity #35<br/>Join a group dedicated to spiritual growth</div>
</b><div class="rev-act-body">Join or found a men's group or women's group dedicated to each person's spiritual growth. Meet regularly and help each other work through daily challenges with beautiful qualities such as integrity, kindness, generosity, bravery, and awareness. Support each other to cultivate and give your sacred gifts. If everyone in the group struggles in the same way, such as having low integrity, take care to truly have high standards and not reinforce each others' weaknesses.</div></div>
