Imagine living in a society without any rulers imposing law, without any police enforcing it, and without any prisons to scare people into submission.

How could people live by their own laws if there isn't any law enforcement? How could there even be laws if there isn't a ruling class to impose them?

In every society I have found without rulers, police, and prisons, I've noticed that people can relax into a deep trust in each other. Okanagan woman Jeannette Armstrong hinted at this trust when she described how "the realization that people and community are there to sustain you creates the most secure feeling in the world..."

If you wanted to be part of a society where you totally trusted everyone else in every way, and you wanted them to trust you just as much, what qualities would you need to cultivate to make that possible?

I believe that "most secure feeling in the world" comes when people can totally trust each other. And for that to happen, each person needs to have total integrity to honor that trust.

Most people know the importance of honesty and promise-keeping, two forms of integrity -- I call them Integrity of Word and Integrity of Action. I want to trust people to tell me the truth, no matter how unpleasant, so I value honesty. I want to be able to rely on people, so I value relationships with people who keep their promises.

There's another way that I believe everybody wants to trust: that people will "do the right thing" or "stand for what's right" even if they haven't explicitly promised to. In other words, people want to trust that others in their society will act in service of their neighbors instead of selfishly, even when they haven't made any specific promises.

This trust that others will act in service is easy to see even in unhealthy cultures. Every infant is born trusting their mother to care for them, without the mother ever making any promises. When I go to the doctor, I trust that the doctor will try to heal me instead of maximizing their pay. Children at school trust the teacher to support their personal growth first, not prioritize their career or pay. This attitude of service is assumed -- how offended would a doctor or teacher be if patients or students wanted them to promise to do their job and not to selfishly maximize their pay? And of course, the newborn couldn't even ask for a promise -- they have no choice but to trust the mother to act in service.

I don't expect any random doctor to heal me or teacher to teach me. But once I enter into a doctor-patient relationship, or a teacher-student relationship, I have this expectation that they'll act in service. A mother creates this trust-relationship by giving birth. Any relationship between people comes with this deep expectation that each will act in service rather than selfishly, even before any explicit promises have been made.

This same desire to trust extends beyond two people, to villages and whole nations. I believe in a deep way, everybody wants to trust that others in their society will act in service of the group rather than selfishly, so I consider acting in service its own kind of integrity -- what I call _Integrity of Service_. 

The Haudenosaunee described how they explicitly raised their children to have the spiritual strength to stand for what's right no matter what: "[Everyone] was socialized to the ideology that, if an injustice occurs, it is their moral duty to defend the oppressed against their oppressors."

Unfortunately, this deep Integrity of Service is forbidden in unhealthy cultures that require people to obey the law, but punish people for upholding the law. That is, people are not allowed to defend the oppressed, as that's supposedly the police's job, though the police are also required to follow orders of even-higher authorities. And thus it is rare for people in unhealthy cultures to cultivate total integrity -- precisely the quality that would allow the deepest solidarity and trust.

### Integrity is the Spiritual Structure of People and Societies

There is good news though: integrity is who we are as humans. You and I and every other person _are_ integrity. You _are_ the act of standing for what's right, or the speaking of the truth, or the keeping of your promise, among many other things. Many people have learned to "hold back" or "shut down" parts of themselves, afraid or ashamed to do what they know in their heart is right, and one way this shows up is low integrity. I believe that for each person, part of learning to "be my best self" involves cultivating a deep integrity.

Integrity is so central to who we are as humans, that the word "integrity" is widely used to mean "strength" or "firmness" in many fields. One engineering company defines _structural integrity_ as "the ability of a structure to withstand its intended load without experiencing failure." When a bridge or building "loses integrity," this means it is close to collapse.

Researchers also describe integrity as part of a person's emotional strength. One psychiatrist defines integrity as "maintaining an integrated, whole self -- bringing oneself 'wholeheartedly' to a situation." Other researchers have illustrated how a person's integrity allows them to maintain a "solid sense of self and emotional balance." Thus a person without integrity is somehow not integrated or whole, or somehow not solid or balanced.

Whether in engineering, psychology, or many other settings, integrity is commonly recognized as the essence of something's structure. Anything without integrity is unreliable, prone to collapse, or not solid. I believe the same is true for healthy cultures.

Just as a bridge requires structural integrity to remain strong, and individuals require integrity to remain integrated and whole, human cultures require integrity to remain healthy.

"Standing for what's right" is the natural urge to uphold the laws you live by. Humans are only supposed to have just laws which are fairly enforced, and healthy cultures maintain this way of life by expecting everyone to stand for what's right all the time -- that's simply what it means for healthy culture to uphold its laws. "Standing for what's right" is a deep form of integrity of service, where each person stands for the wellbeing of the whole group.[xxx-needs work]

People can agree to protect each other from attack, share resources, or agree to live respectfully together, but will they actually keep their agreements? Integrity allows people to uphold the laws they choose to live by, and thus I believe integrity forms the structure of any healthy culture. Can I rely on my neighbors to support me if enemies approach? If one neighbor acts disrespectfully, can I rely on the rest of my neighbors to stand in solidarity with me, and ensure that everyone enjoys a baseline of mutual respect?

This all comes down to integrity. Do people consistently speak the truth and keep their promises, even when it might be uncomfortable or dangerous? Do my neighbors "do the right thing" even if they haven't promised to? If not, then I cannot trust my neighbors, and I'm on my own. When people consistently show integrity, then everybody can relax into a deep trust of each other. We know that we can rely on each other no matter what comes, and I believe this widespread, total integrity is part of what allows people to maintain a healthy culture, where "the most secure feeling in the world" is simply a normal part of life.

### Bravery: the Capacity to Act in Service in any Situation

For years I thought of bravery as the ability to aggressively face danger without fear. Eventually I found a deeper perspective on bravery offered by the Sioux man Ohiyesa:

> [An Indian's] own conception of bravery makes of it a high moral virtue, for to him it consists not so much in aggressive self-assertion as in absolute self-control. The truly brave man, we contend, yields neither to fear nor anger, desire nor agony; he is at all times master of himself; his courage rises to the heights of chivalry, patriotism, and real heroism.

I think of bravery this way: _A person showing bravery remains fully conscious and acts in service of what matters under any challenge._

In other words, bravery is simply a person's ability to act in service no matter what. That is, they'll "do the right thing" or "stand for what's right" even if it's scary or uncomfortable.

If people only stood in solidarity when it felt comfortable, solidarity would not be worth much! It's people's willingness to stand for what's right or have integrity of service even when it's hard that gives relationships strength. It's also what allows people to deeply trust each other.

Ohiyesa described how far the Sioux took this bravery: "'Let neither cold, hunger, nor pain, nor the fear of them, neither the bristling teeth of danger nor the very jaws of death itself, prevent you from doing a good deed,' said an old chief to a scout who was about to seek the buffalo in midwinter for the relief of a starving people. This was his childlike conception of courage."

When people are trained not to choose and uphold their own laws, and they're punished for illegally upholding the law, they're essentially trained for cowardice. Instead of standing for what's right at all costs, submissive people learn to maximize their safety and comfort while hoping the police take care of the problems. Some people, such as police or soldiers, are trained to show bravery but only when they're following orders. Thus abusive and selfish behavior continues, seemingly endlessly.

### Integrity and Bravery can be Practiced

I have good news: like authenticity, gratitude, and many other qualities, both integrity and bravery can be practiced.

In a really scary or uncomfortable situation, an untrained person can feel overwhelmed and their consciousness becomes clouded. Such a person may act selfishly or hurtfully, not out of clear, calm decision-making, but out of an untrained, instinctual response to overwhelming feelings.

Thus a major aspect of training bravery is to train myself not to feel overwhelmed when I'm scared or uncomfortable. I practice remaining conscious and clear-minded even in very scary or uncomfortable moments. I call this _feeling comfortable in the midst of discomfort_.

The best way to practice remaining conscious when I feel uncomfortable is to intentionally put myself in difficult situations, and practice remaining conscious. In other words, I intentionally cause myself to feel discomfort so that I can practice relating to it in a good way.

A beautiful example comes from the mother of Sioux man Little Crow. She was a chief's daughter and widely recognized for her spirit and beauty. Shortly after Little Crow was born, she would take him to an ice covered lake, find a hole in the ice, and plunge her baby into the water. Then she would rub him with snow afterwards to strengthen his nerves. However, Little Crow remained completely safe in his loving mother's arms. Thus Little Crow learned to associate a sense of safety and comfort with the discomfort of severe freezing cold. She also took him out into the deep woods for days at a time so that he would feel comfortable with solitude and not fear being alone in the wilderness. At a young age, she threw a feast for Little Crow and announced that he would fast for two days. She did these things because she wanted him to be a worthy leader of his people.

She said, "My son, if you are to be a leader of men, you must listen in silence to the mystery, the spirit."

I have found cold-training very helpful, and I recommend Wim Hof's cold training program, where participants take on a slightly bigger cold challenge each week. Participants start with a warm shower followed by a 30-second cold shower each day for the first week. For each day in the second week, participants take a 30-second cold shower, a normal warm shower, and then a 30-second cold shower. Each following week becomes a little harder. Eventually I was taking 20 minute long ice baths and stayed comfortably in near-freezing ocean water for 90 minutes while harvesting seaweed.

This careful progression is essential. Consistently facing one's edge or one's fears helps cultivate bravery, as well as whatever other skill is being practiced. Increasing difficulty too fast could cause injury or demotivation, and too little difficulty does not improve bravery or the other skills.

An excellent practice for cultivating integrity and bravery is simple: always face your fears. Why would a person lie, or break a promise? Often because they're afraid of the consequences of doing whats right. Why do people do cowardly things like side with the big bully instead of standing with the victim, or pretending to believe falsehoods just because their job depends on it? Of course -- because doing the right thing can be scary.

These are simple truths that any kindergartner knows, and I believe they're fundamental to generating a healthy culture. To anyone who wishes to be part of creating a new healthy culture, I strongly suggest: cultivate your integrity and bravery, ideally with others in a group where people lovingly hold each other to a high standard of excellence.

When whole nations of people cultivate bravery and integrity as a normal way of life, the resulting stories are breathtaking. American colonel RI Dodge encountered the bravery and physical training of Apache warriors, and he wrote, "The tenacity of life of an Indian, the amount of lead he will carry off, indicates a nervous system so dull as to class him with brutes rather than men... I myself have seen an Indian go off with two bullets through his body, within an inch of his spine, the only effect of which was to cause him to change his gait from a run to a dignified walk."

This shows how easily people can make foolish assumptions. Colonel Dodge was fighting against warriors who trained to run as much as 75 miles per day for days in a row, intentionally cultivated bravery, and were heavily motivated to protect the land and people they loved. Instead of noticing the warriors' deep love, bravery and physical capability, Dodge thought they were unfeeling brutes because they kept going even when he shot them repeatedly.

My final suggestion is this: _build a library of stories of brave people_. Surround yourself with brave people and stories about them to help build your own courage. This way bravery won't seem rare, but just a normal and excellent way of life.

When a group has widespread, pervasive integrity and bravery, then I believe widespread trust and _the most secure feeling in the world_ will naturally follow.
