## Chapter 13: Now You Know the Biggest Secret in the History of Humanity

Ruling classes consistently train people not to know that healthy cultures exist. In other words, for thousands of years, wage slaves, chattel slaves, and other slaves have been kept ignorant of the existence of free nations, or they've been trained to misunderstand them. That makes the existance of healthy cultures the biggest secret in the history of humanity, kept by ruling classes for millennia all around the world.

And now, you know the secret: healthy cultures do exist, whole nations that maintain a baseline of respect internally because everybody stands for what's right, and nobody rules over anybody else. And that is proof that it's possible to live in a beautiful way, without all the cultural and political problems so many of us consider "just the way life is."

For millennia, ruling classes have done their best to keep the existence of healthy cultures a secret, and when you know what to look for, the history books show this vividly.

Just as the Americans and Israelis are calling anti-genocide protesters "antisemitic" and punishing them, European colonial authorities centuries ago likewise called people of healthy cultures "ignorant", "savages," "uneducated," and "the antichrist." Centuries of lies and manipulation in North and South America, Africa, Australia, and around the world trained European colonists to fear and hate people of healthy cultures instead of see them as potential mentors, friends and allies. Chapter 2 showed that sometimes the secret got out, and some colonists did indeed run away to live in freedom with healthy cultures.

Why would ruling classes work so hard throughout history to spread propaganda against healthy cultures? David Mantell, author of the _True Americanism_ study, said it clearly: "It is difficult to live in a permanent state of rebellion, and rebellions rarely occur when people do not have standards of comparison or do not see the chance of changing their circumstances."

Most people either haven't heard of healthy cultures or they misunderstand them, so they have no standard of comparison, and they're likely to accept their unhealthy culture as "good enough." British prime minister Winston Churchill even said, "democracy is the worst form of government except for all those other forms that have been tried..." Of course, if you believe the only alternative to authoritarian democracy is being ruled by a king, priest or imam, then you'll just do your best to make democracy "work." But what if you learned what freedom was like by studying actually-free people, and what if you found plenty of examples from today or recent times, including case studies of successful revolutionary movements?

What if you realized how much your unhealthy culture had trained you and your ancestors to hold back your deepest love and tolerate endless abusive behavior all around you?

And what if you could see that it doesn't need to be this way, that you and people around you could unite to create a new nation where respect is the norm?

At that moment, everything changes. The secret is out!

Once you know what healthy cultures are like, you have that standard of comparison. You can see that voting will never lead to deep change because slaves have never voted their way to freedom. You can see that endless TV debates between left and right, liberals and conservatives, and capitalists and socialists are all merely a distraction from the conversations that might lead to real transformation.

Instead of engaging in endless political debates that have never helped people find freedom, what if you imagined the kind of world you wanted to live in? And what if you worked with others to bring your vision to life?

### Imagine...

Imagine a life where every moment felt alive, you were surrounded by people you trusted and liked, and free to contribute to your community in the most meaningful ways.





Imagine having enough time with your kids. Imagine having enough time to make their education really excellent, so that every day was meaningful and engaging for them.
Imagine being a teenager and being treated so respectfully that there was nothing to rebel against! 

Imagine no boring classes, no unaccountable school authorities, and no meaningless work and tests. Imagine instead 


raising children so that every day was meaningful for them, training them for qualities like deep generosity, bravery, connection, and joy so that these become normal parts of their lives and pervasive in your culture. Imagine teenagers who don't rebel because there's no disrespect to rebel against, and adults have the time and energy to make kids' education as meaningful as possible every day.

Imagine the relief you'd feel knowing that corrupt politicians and businessmen won't spread misunderstandings and block 

Imagine finding your childhood innocence again, joyfully offering your deepest love in each moment surrounded by other people giving theirs. Because of course no one loses their innocence, people merely forget it when they embrace shame, low self-worth, selfishness, distrust, superficiality, distraction, or other hurtful attitudes. And anything that's been forgotten can be remembered again...
Not placating or belittling you, but welcoming your deepest love and not settling for less.

Imagine if people took care of their neighborhoods instead of letting it get trashy, as people with dignity and self-respect likewise respect the space where they live and no authorities would stand in the way.

Imagine not worrying about health care, knowing the healers around you will give your their gifts...

Imagine not worrying about retirement...

Imagine not thinking of life as a rat race, but waking up each day excited for the adventure ahead.

Imagine seeing the Earth's gifts everywhere you look and feeling a continuous state of gratitude for all of life's blessings.  feeling the Earth's love around you constantly

Imagine feeling indebted because your neighbors just give you so much that you constantly feel the urge to give back, with the endless sharing just increasing the joyful indebtedness. Who would want to wipe clean such happy debts? 

Imagine learning befriending the deer and bears, the chestnuts and hickories, the stinging nettle and chickweed, and learning how to feed them. Imagine knowing the plants and animals so intimately that you could them grow even as you harvest some to eat.

so that a life of reciprocity feels abundant and joyful.

No one can predict or control the future. Times of sickness or hunger might come, or war and migration. Imagine trusting that the people around you will take care of you, just like you'll take care of them. Imagine relaxing into that "realization that people and community are there to sustain you [which] creates the most secure feeling in the world..." 

I didn't make these up. Every imagined scene here came from a story or observation from an actual healthy culture. These don't need to be fantasies. You and other people could bring them to life.

### Bring Your Vision to Life

Your vision is possible. What kind of person would you need to be in order to bring such a beautiful and powerful vision to life? And what kind of relationships could you cultivate 












### Will You Forget Your Vision?

You could work with other people to bring your vision to life, or you could forget it.

I want to tell you the story of someone who forgot, because the story showed me how to remember a beautiful vision.

I know someone who, in the early 1990s, thought about whether it was ok for the US to invade Iraq. She had never engaged in politics much, but as the United States invaded Iraq, she wondered, is the US invading to bring democracy? Or take oil? Is it ok to kill people to take oil?

These were very deep questions! 

She was unable to find other people to share her concerns with, and speak her heart. Her husband was involved with the war, which only made it more challenging. She was surrounded by people, but unable to discuss what mattered to her and consider how to respond with others.

Over time, she became more stressed, and she and her husband began speaking of divorce. She had the career and family of her dreams but was unhappy and felt stuck and alone. Finally, she decided to take anti-depressants, which allowed her to numb the feeling of dissatisfaction without responding to it. And she stopped asking such deep questions about politics.

Plenty of people who feel trapped and unable to respond to their fears cope by numbing their feelings with endless distractions, whether through screen addiction, drugs, overworking, or other ways. These are simply ways people learn to "hold back" or "shut down" parts of themselves to avoid feeling their own dissatisfaction.
