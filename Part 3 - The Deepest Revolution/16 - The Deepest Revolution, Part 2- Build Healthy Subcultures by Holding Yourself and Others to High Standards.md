## Chapter 16: The Deepest Revolution, Part 2: Build Healthy Subcultures by Building Spiritual Strength with Others

Can you imagine what life would be like if you deeply trusted everyone around you to stand for what's right and take care of each other no matter what?

Okanagan woman Jeannette Armstrong described this deep trust vividly when she said, "The realization that people and community are there to sustain you creates the most secure feeling in the world."[xxx-original instructions|armstrong]

In order to have this deep trust, people of healthy cultures consistently hold each other to high standards of excellent and beautiful behavior. In other words, they have high expectations or standards for each other for qualities like integrity, generosity, awareness, authenticity, physical resilience, joyfulness, personal growth, walking a meaningful path, and bravery.

When qualities like deep integrity and generosity become widespread, it's easy to see how trust becomes widespread too.

A key aspect of creating a new healthy culture is remembering or learning how to hold yourself and others to a high standard. Plenty of stories from healthy cultures show just how high our standards could be for each other.

_Integrity:_ In every legal system around the world, people are required to testify under oath, and they are threatened with severe punishment for lying. The assumption is that if participants would lie if they weren't threatened with severe punishment.

In contrast, integrity was so pervasive among the traditional Apache that they did not compel anyone to take an oath because, according to Geronimo, "it is not believed that they will give false testimony in a matter relating to their own people."[xxx-geronimo autobio|Unwritten Laws of the Apaches]

Can you imagine if there was no need for an oath to tell the truth, because people in your group already expected total honesty from each other as a normal way of life?

_Physical resilience:_: Crow woman Pretty Shield described how physically resilient her people were when they lived in a traditional way. She said, "Ahh, my people were tough in those days... [W]hen I was young, if in winter a person fell into icy water, he got out, took off his wet clothes, and rolled in the snow, rubbing his body with it, and got warm. Then, after squeezing out the water, he put on his clothes and forgot about getting wet. Now my people wear gloves, and too many clothes. We are soft as mud."[xxx-red mother|p84]

Can you imagine if the people around you were so physically resilient that even being soaking wet in winter was nothing to worry about, but just a little trouble to fix?

_Generosity:_ A Christian missionary once visited men of the Ojibway, Cheyenne, Cree and Sioux nations, and he described Jesus Christ's selfless generosity. Christ gave away all his possessions and urged others to do the same while dedicating his life to feeding, healing, and protecting his people. The missionary was told that, prior to colonization, Jesus Christ's level of selfless generosity was simply normal among them.[xxx-from deep woods to civilization|civ preached practiced]

Can you imagine living in a nation where someone like Jesus Christ was considered admirable but not remarkable because such selfless generosity is simply normal and expected?

_Meaningful Education for Young People:_ One Nootka storyteller described how the women would often have their moon time at the same time each month, and they would go to a special house and enjoy a four-day party. They would sit on special soft moss and give their blood back to the Earth and play games and talk. Women would rub each others' back and make special tea if someone had cramps. This became a major opportunity for older women to mentor younger women. For example, young women learned the special Frog posture that could help relieve cramps and make childbirth easier.

Could you imagine if adults took young people's education seriously, offering them the most meaningful mentorship they could every day?

_Benefitting the Earth:_ Stories abound of people of healthy cultures actually _benefitting_ the Earth as a normal way of life rather than depleting it. Robin Kimmerer described how Black Ash trees actually became _more abundant_ in regions where it was respectfully harvested by Mohawk and Potawatomi basket makers, and this remains true today.[xxx-braiding sweetgrass|wisgaak gokpenagen] Apache man Stalking Wolf described how he respectfully harvested a sapling to make a bow in such a way that the overall forest benefitted, and the chosen tree yielded a powerful bow.[xxx-the vision|p80]

Can you imagine if your normal way of life benefitted the Earth around you, increasing the natural abundance that you depended on?

When people really bring out the best in each other, have high expectations, or hold each other to a high standard, we humans really are capable of maintaining that baseline of mutual respect among each other, and between people and the Earth.

In a sense, members of the Potawatomi, Apache, Nootka, and other nations are people like anyone else. They have attitudes, skills and awareness that anybody could cultivate -- including you and the people around you.

You could hold yourself and the people around you to a high standard of integrity. You and the people around you could cultivate physical resilience, mentor young people in a good way, and learn how to receive the Earth's gifts in a way that actually benefits the Earth.

This is the path to building a culture of deep trust. Have high expectations for yourself and the people around you so that qualities like integrity, bravery, awareness, and generosity are simply normal and expected.

<div class="rev-act"><div class="rev-act-header">Revolutionary Activity #26<br/>Remember when you were held to a high standard</div>
<div class="rev-act-body">Think of a time when someone had faith in you, maybe even more faith than you had in yourself. Did someone help you find the self-respect to leave an abusive romantic relationship? Did a coach help you cultivate the discipline to train at your sport and be the best you could be? Did a teacher help you realize you could be great at whatever you put your mind to? If this mentor did their job properly, they did not shame or punish you for messing up, but helped you see your unmet potential and urged you to reach it -- to be your best self, and not settle for less. Think of an example like this where someone really brought out the best in you, holding you to a high standard.<br/><br/>Now imagine being part of a group where everybody supported each other this way continually, in all areas of life. No one imposes their ideology on you, but they hold you to a high standard of excellent and beautiful behavior in your job, family life, social groups, and activism work, bringing out the best in you every day. And imagine you get to support others in the same way. How would that feel?</div></div>

#### When People Develop Low Standards

One universal consequence of being conquered is that people may be tempted to accept their own submissive obedience as legitimate and normal. When this happens, _people's standards for themselves and each other drop a lot._ In other words, when a person or group finally accepts obedient submission, they stop expecting very much of themselves or others. People don't really expect life to be deeply meaningful, or don't trust other people, or learn to focus mostly on themselves or pleasing others instead of standing for what's right. People may engage in superficial or wishful thinking, and even adopt the ideologies of their abusers.

The underlying attitudes are things like, "Why care too much about the Earth around me if I only need money to survive?" or "Why confront injustice if I don't trust others to stand with me, and if it wouldn't do any good anyway?" or "I don't trust anyone and need to look after myself."

As Part 2 showed, unhealthy cultures reward and encourage all our worst qualities, such as selfishness, cowardice, disconnection from each other and the Earth, ignorance, and superficiality. When people stop standing for what's right, and instead focus on keeping their job or wealth while staying out of trouble, these qualities can become widespread.

Widespread low standards or low expectations have many tragic consequences for both men and women. However, one of the most striking consequences is that boys struggle to become good men, and good men are rare in unhealthy cultures.

A core masculine gift is that of setting boundaries, especially protecting one's people from threats. In all cultures, few things inspire men more than the need to protect their people from danger. And yet, in unhealthy cultures, the rulers are the greatest threat to the people. The greatest threat is not from outside; it is within the culture itself.

As a result, abusive cultures raise boys not to honor their innate spiritual calling to protect their people from threats as a gift of love, without any compensation or orders. Instead, men commonly grow up learning to tolerate, ignore, or perpetuate abuse.

When boys are raised to deny or twist this deep love-gift of boundary-setting and protection, unhealthy cultures wind up with deeply spiritually confused men who ask questions like "When does life become meaningful?" or "Why am I even here?"

Recall that spirituality is simply how a person relates to themselves and the world. When a man's deep gift of protective boundary-setting is not welcome in their unhealthy culture, it is difficult for a man to know how to relate to himself and the world. In other words, he can become spiritually lost.

This ultimately is the spiritual reality behind Henry David Thoreau's comment that "The mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation."[xxx-walden] It also explains the famous statement that "Every man dies. Not every man really lives."[xxx-braveheart every man] Living a life where a person has learned to hold back their love and not stand for what's right is deeply unsatisfying.

This also explains why women in unhealthy cultures around the world keep asking, "Where are all the good men?" Whether in feminist literature from the Americas, Europe, or Asia, this is a common question going back to the dawn of unhealthy cultures.[xxx-odoc|ch47]

Of course, women can set boundaries and protect their people too. And yet, when this protective boundary-setting is forbidden in unhealthy cultures, a core masculine gift is rejected, and many men become spiritually lost.

People endlessly debate the meaning of "toxic masculinity," and this perspective gets to the heart of the trouble: unhealthy cultures do not train boys to be good men, because good men stand for what's right and protect their people from any threat, and authorities forbid this. Boys learn to cope with this deep trouble in a variety of ways. Some become selfish or become people pleasers, or distract themselves from their meaningless life with things like alcohol, drugs, superficial hobbies, or overwork.

Rain-in-the-Face was a Sioux warrior who fought to protect his people from the encroaching American military. Finally, after much fighting, his people decided to submit and move onto an Indian reservation. He described what happened to his spirit when he finally stopped protecting his people and standing for what's right: "I fought for my people and my country... Rain-In-The-Face was killed when he put down his weapons before the Great Father [US president]. His spirit was gone then; only his poor body lived on..."[xxx-indian heroes and great chieftains|rain-in-the-face]

Every transition into unhealthy cultures required this deep spiritual wounding in men where they are expected to hold back their love and not protect their people from the biggest threats. Rain-In-The-Face could at least recognize his spiritual wound because he had grown up in a culture that welcomed his deepest love. He knew what giving his love and setting protective boundaries was like, so he knew something was wrong when these gifts were unwelcome in the unhealthy culture.

Most boys in unhealthy cultures never learn what it's like to give their deepest love because they're trained for obedience instead of standing for what's right. Training children for obedience actually trains them for cowardice, as they learn to take the comfortable and safe path (of doing what they're told to stay out of trouble) instead of bravely standing for what's right, even contrary to the authorities.

When children are trained for obedience, is it any wonder that cowardice is common in adulthood, and people have low trust in each other?

When boys are trained for cowardly obedience instead of bravely protecting their people from any threat or abuse, is it any surprise that so many women wonder where all the good men are? And when so many men are lost, is it any surprise that most men don't know what the women are talking about?

Of course, women can become lost too, such as those who believe women can be "liberated" by becoming well-paid wage slaves, selfish executives and corrupt politicians in their unhealthy culture, just like men have done for millennia.

Instead of seeking real freedom where everyone stands for what's right as a normal way of life, authorities in unhealthy cultures trick everyone into thinking that "freedom" just means being able to do whatever you want without financial or cultural restrictions, and so the way to be free is to get rich. But this is the faux-freedom of kings who don't have to care about anyone else or follow any laws.

Real freedom comes when everyone stands for what's right as a normal way of life, so that everyone can enjoy justice and deep respect from their neighbors. When people forget this and just look after themselves, it's easy to become spiritually lost and let selfishness take over.

Another way to see our low standards is this: how many people show the same spiritual strength as Jesus Christ, Harriet Tubman, or Martin Luther King Jr? They've been heavily celebrated for their very unusual bravery and service, and yet in a healthy culture their spiritual strength would simply be considered normal! They would be considered admirable and inspiring, but normal because everyone is expected to have the spiritual strength to stand for what's right at any moment. That's simply the baseline expectation in healthy cultures.

When you know what to look for, you will see how low our expectations are for each other in unhealthy cultures. But it doesn't need to be this way. And to create healthy subcultures and eventually sovereign healthy cultures, we need to raise our standards!

#### Find Like-Minded People and Commit to High Standards of Excellent and Beautiful Behavior Together

MAKE THIS AN EPIC RANT. IT's TIME to END THIS BULLShIT.

In order for humans to have a culture, there have to be agreements on appropriate or inappropriate behavior, and systems of accountability.

In unhealthy cultures, governments impose laws that define good and bad behavior. In subcultures, it's normal for an authority figure to impose the rules. For example, in a kids' sports team, the coach defines the rules for the kids. In corporations, the CEO defines the rules for the employees. The enforcement of these rules form the structure of the culture or subculture; the rules and their enforcement form the boundaries of what is acceptable or unacceptable.

These "laws" or "rules" are simply descriptions or agreements of behavior that that the group accepts or doesn't accept. When you and others form a group where people commit to high standards of behavior, you're effectively creating your own law within your subculture.

This is the ancient and instinctive source of natural law in human societies: when everyone embraces integrity and stands for what's right, people's high standards for good behavior become the laws they live by.

"Integrity" is consistently recognized as the essence of something's structure. One engineering company defines _structural integrity_ as "the ability of a structure to withstand its intended load without experiencing failure."[xxx-arch struxure integrity] When a bridge or building "loses integrity," this means it is close to collapse. In psychology, integrity is related to someone's balance, wholeness, or solid sense of self.

Integrity is likewise the essence of a healthy culture's structure. People can agree to live in a respectful way, but will they keep their agreements and actually uphold respectful boundaries? When integrity is widespread and people uphold their agreements for how to live, they can relax into that deep trust.

Integrity is the complement of trust. For every way that people want to trust each other, there's a  kind of integrity. "Speaking the truth" and "keeping promises" are two forms of integrity, which are essential to forming trusting relationships. However, people in the same culture also expect each other to act in service even without promising to do so, and this is an essential aspect of trust. An infant trusts her mother to act in service without making any promise. Students trust their teacher to act in service. Patients expect their doctor to heal them instead of maximizing their profit. Leaders are expected to serve the people instead of corruptly serving themselves. I call this "integrity of service."

When everyone stands for what's right as a normal way of life -- when that integrity of service is common -- then people can maintain that baseline of mutual respect, even in situations that their past agreements didn't foresee. I believe this explains the Haudenosaunee writer's statement that their "society was founded on concepts of moral justice, not statute law."

When the law and justice are in conflict, which should a culture prioritize? When everyone stands for what's right continuously, they will consistently seek justice instead of mindlessly following their law. "Laws" or "rules" are simply agreements people make to help live in a good way, but in a healthy culture if the law and justice are in conflict, past agreements are never allowed to prevent justice when someone is threatened or attacked.

This explains why deep integrity is so rare in unhealthy cultures. When authorities impose law, and forbid people from upholding the law they live by, they're actually forbidding integrity of service -- the deepest form of integrity. People may still be allowed to have some kinds of integrity, such as speaking the truth, or keeping promises, but in unhealthy cultures people are not allowed to act in service by confronting authorities' injustices. This aspect of integrity is forbidden.

Thus the path to creating a healthy subculture involves holding yourself and others to a high standard of integrity, in secret if you must. Find like-minded people willing to commit to deep spiritual growth, and make agreements for how to relate to each other and the Earth in a respectful way. When you can hold each other to a high standard of integrity so that people consistently uphold the agreements and act in service, you'll be able to relax into that deep trust knowing you're surrounded by trustworthy people.

#### Everything is a Skill, and Everything Can Be Practiced Without Guilt or Shame

Think back to a skill you learned as a child. Imagine, for example, that you learned to play soccer. You learned lots of smaller skills such as how to dribble or pass the ball. To get better at passing, what did you do?

You practiced: you tried your best to kick the soccer ball to someone, and sometimes the ball went where you intended and sometimes it didn't. When you kicked the ball in the wrong direction, you figured out what lesson to learn, hopefully without any shame, and then practiced passing the ball with those new lessons in mind. The more you practiced, the more lessons you learned, and the better you got at passing the ball. When you approached all the skills of soccer this way, eventually you became a skilled soccer player.

Qualities like integrity, awareness, gratitude, and generosity are simply skills too, and you can practice them intentionally just like any other skill. Practice approaching life with qualities like awareness, integrity, and generosity, and then notice when you up with these qualities and when you don't. Perhaps sometime you don't have the awareness you want, or you are afraid to tell the truth and so you lie to someone.

Cultivating qualities such as integrity, awareness and generosity is just like learning to kick a soccer ball. When you mess up, avoid any sense of guilt or shame. Just recognize that you made a mistake, and you can learn from it and do better next time. If you hurt or disappointed someone else, acknowledge your mistake, do your best to make it right, learn whatever lessons you can, and commit to doing better next time. And if you feel any residual fear, guilt, or shame, just let them go.

Deep spiritual growth can be joyful rather than stressful when you approach it without shame and guilt. So long as you're truly committed to that path of spiritual growth, mistakes are simply learning opportunities along the way.

When I really embraced this attitude, my rate of spiritual growth skyrocketed. In other words, I started learning life lessons faster than before, because I wasn't wasting time feeling shame and guilt. I just noticed my mistakes and learned from them.

#### Build a Healthy Subculture by Building Spiritual Strength Together

It's not easy to learn a new way of life. 









It's crucial to learn life lessons efficiently without guilt and shame, because there are many skills needed to have a healthy culture.

When someone acts dishonestly, what would it take to begin trusting them again? It's crucial to have a _path back to grace_ so people know that if they make a mistake, there're not shunned forever, but there's a way to prove that they've really grown and can be trusted again.

When someone makes a mistake, when is it most helpful to offer unconditional acceptance, and when would it be more helpful to show them their own unmet potential and accept nothing less than excellent behavior?

How can you recognize when someone else is fully giving their sacred gifts and when they're holding back, and when you see they're holding back, how could you help them give themselves fully again?

All these are skills, and all these can be practiced without guilt or shame.

Ultimately, this is a key way to build spiritual strength with others. Hold yourself and others to a high standard of excellent and beautiful behavior. When someone struggles, help them grow without shame or guilt. People commonly rise or fall to the level of expectations set for them. To create a healthy subculture with pervasive trust, hold yourself and others to a high standard as a gift of love.

#### Serve the Earth Together

* Can serve the Earth either by enriching it (ie planting trees, tending the soil) or protecting it from further destruction

* Rev-act: one way or another, as a group, serve the Earth where you live. Cultivate a sense of place and gratitude for the specific gifts all around you.
