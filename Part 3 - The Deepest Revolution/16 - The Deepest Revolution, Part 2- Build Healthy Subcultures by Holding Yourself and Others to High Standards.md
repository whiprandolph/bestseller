## Chapter 16: The Deepest Revolution, Pt 2: Build Healthy Subcultures by Holding Yourself and Others to High Standards

### When People are discouraged from developing high standards and are rewarded for low standards, the outcome is dismal

Once people are conquered, and they accept being ruled in their unhealthy culture as normal and legitimate, _people's standards for themselves and each other drops a lot._ In other words, when a person or group finally considers it legitimate and ok to submit to authorities, they stop expecting very much of themselves or each other. People don't really expect life to be deeply meaningful, don't deeply trust others, or learn to focus mostly on themselves or pleasing others to keep life comfortable.

The underlying attitudes are things like, "Why bother cultivating deep integrity and bravery if I just want to keep my comfortable, predictable life and not rock the boat?" or "Why confront injustice if I don't trust others to stand with me, and if it wouldn't do any good anyway?"

As Part 2 showed, unhealthy cultures reward and encourage all our worst qualities, such as selfishness, cowardice, disconnection from each other and the Earth, ignorance, and superficiality. When people stop standing for what's right, and instead focus on keeping their job or wealth while staying out of trouble, these qualities can become widespread.

### Find like-minded people on a similar path
* Where to find them
* How to befriend them 
* Expect challenges and grow beyond them by holding yourself and others to high standards

For many people, one of the hardest beliefs to release comes down to trust: can you imagine completely trusting the people around you? Even if you don't trust the people around you right now, can you imagine even the possibility of finding others with whom you could have a deep trust relationship, knowing everyone else has the spiritual strength to honor your trust?


### High Standards: Our Only Way to Collectively Be Who We Really Are
* No healthy culture is possible without high standards
* No hope of defeating powerful rulers without high standards
* The deepest revolution requires integrity

### Integrity and Natural Law

* integrity as structure in psychology, engineering -- and healthy cultures

* everyone's collective integrity is the structure of a healthy culture -- the source of law when no one imposes law on anyone else

Law is just the standard of behaviors people agree on. When Law is imposed, people are unable to uphold their own law.

In practice, that means when standards of behavior are imposed, people don't uphold their own high standards of behavior -- and standards fall.

### Everything is a Skill

* integrity, bravery, awareness, gratitude -- all these can be practiced like any other skill. So practice them, and help others practice to bring out the best in each other

* Bravery: quick definition, practice being in scary & uncomfortable situations and doing the right thing

  * Training children (or anybody) for obedience trains them for cowardice. 

* Integrity: 
    * complement of "trust", meaning there's a kind of integrity for every way that people want to trust each other: honesty, promise-keeping, integrity of service
    * practice honesty, keeping your promises, and acting in service instead of focusing just on oneself

### Build Revolutionary Healthy Subcultures by Holding Yourself and Others to High Standards

* commit to personal growth and collective growth with others

* people live up or down to expectations set for them

* your gifts matter more when you have others to give them to -- people who are grateful and who expect nothing less

* expectations you set become the law you live by -- ie the standards of behavior you expect from yourself and others

### Treat Children Respectfully

* Apache man Geronimo said, “When I was about eight or ten years old I began to follow the chase, and to me this was never work.”32 Ohiyesa wrote, “I hardly think I was ever tired in my life until those first days of boarding-school.”33 Ohiyesa also noted, “The Indian boy enjoyed such a life as almost all boys dream of and would choose for themselves if they were permitted to do so.”

* One very challenging aspect of finding freedom: adults who were raised to be obedient must learn to raise children to take deep responsibility for themselves and others without submissive obedience. Having high expectations of them for whatever stage of growth they are in.

### Give to the Earth Together

* Can serve the Earth either by enriching it (ie planting trees, tending the soil) or protecting it from further destruction

* one way or another, as a group, serve the Earth where you live. Cultivate a sense of place and gratitude for the specific gifts all around you.

### When People Have High Expectations for Themselves and Each Other, What Kind of Culture Will They Create?

* all the beautiful things -- awareness of each other and Earth, integrity, generosity, mutual respect -- all the qualities of healthy cultures. Just lacking freedom... hmm...

* still big problems -- but people would figure it out.

  * could study other healthy cultures -- how do they pick leaders? How do they maintain culture of generous sharing over time?

  * and trust in your own ability to make mistakes and learn from them

  * commit before you know the path, and embrace uncertainty

  * Deepest Revolution never ends, because people will always be standing for what's right as needed - continual humility
