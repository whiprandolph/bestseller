## The Deepest Revolution

### Always Remember Another Way of Life is Possible

Ruling classes consistently train people not to know that healthy cultures exist. In other words, enslaved people have been kept ignorant of the existence of free nations, or trained to misunderstand them. Just as the Americans and Israelis are calling anti-genocide protesters "antisemitic" and punishing them, and white slave owners severely punished poor white people who supported black people, authorities likewise called people of healthy cultures "ignorant", "savages," "uneducated," and "antichrist." Centuries of lies and manipulation in North and South America, and likely elsewhere, trained European colonists to fear and hate people of healthy cultures instead of see them as inspiration. Chapter 2 showed that this didn't always work, and some colonists did indeed run away to live in freedom with healthy cultures.

Why would ruling classes work so hard to spread propaganda against healthy cultures? David Mantell, author of the _True Americanism_ study, said it clearly: "It is difficult to live in a permanent state of rebellion, and rebellions rarely occur when people do not have standards of comparison or do not see the chance of changing their circumstances."

* Study healthy cultures, become friends with people who carry their healthy-culture traditions. Healthy cultures have found a huge variety of ways of sharing food, choosing servant-leaders, having sexual relationships, eating nutritious diets, raising strong children, living in harmony with the Earth, addressing inappropriate behavior, responding to threats, and more. Consider which ways could work for you, and which wouldn't, and what lessons to learn.

### Find People To Whom You Can Speak Your Heart

* ref mom's story - I know someone who, in the early 1990s, thought about whether it was ok for the US to invade Iraq. She wondered, is the US invading to bring democracy? Or take oil? Is it ok to kill people to take oil?

Unfortunately, she was the wife of a US military officer living on an overseas base, surrounded by soldiers and their spouses. She was unable to find other people to share her concerns with, and speak her heart. She was surrounded by people, but unable to discuss what mattered to her and consider how to respond with others.

Over time, she became more stressed, and she and her husband began speaking of divorce. She had the career and family of her dreams but was deeply unhappy. Finally, she decided to take anti-depressants, which allowed her to numb the feeling of dissatisfaction without responding to it. She stopped thinking deeply about politics.

Plenty of people who feel trapped and unable to respond to their fears cope by numbing their feelings with endless distractions, whether through screen addiction, drugs, overworking, or other ways. These are simply ways people learn to "hold back" or "shut down" parts of themselves to avoid feeling their own dissatisfaction when they don't see a way to respond productively.

The most important step to addressing any concerns or fears you have is this: find other people you trust to tell them how you feel and your concerns and thoughts, and listen to them too. If you don't trust anyone in your life this much, then make new friends.

* This showed me the importance of finding someone you can speak your heart to. Either deepen the friendships you have, or make new friends.

* find people. Start with 1 if you need to, then find another after that.

### Dignity and Self-Respect: Give Your Gifts Even in the Face of Hopelessness

* People treat their living spaces like they treat themselves. 


* Practice not only cleaning up after yourself, but cleaning up after other people. When I visit my sit spot each day, there is always new trash, and I always pick up some and put it in the bin. I know it doesn't reduce the amount of trash in the world, but just moves it out of my area. And I know there will be more trash tomorrow, so I know I can't make it permanently clean. But leaving the world more beautiful and more excellent than I found it is who I am -- and it's who you are too.

Even if things seem hopeless, with huge environmental troubles, imperialism, and oppression, you can still move through the world with dignity and self-respect, offering your gifts.

Black Elk showed me how to have this kind of bravery, to give my deepest love even when things look bleak. He and other Lakota expected to die once after being captured by the Americans. They dressed for death and began singing death songs as they wished to end life bravely even if they could not escape. He said, "if it was the end of our lives and we could do nothing, we wanted to die brave. We could not fight this that was going to kill us, but we could die so that our spirit relatives would not be ashamed of us."

Humans may well go extinct soon -- or maybe not. Nuclear war, climate change, and the spread of chemical toxins all can seem overwhelming and inevitable. 


But the truth is that many people have struggled with despair and depression for millennia. William Wallace said, "Every man dies. Not every man truly lives."



### Commit to Personal Growth with Others

* Hold yourself and others to a high standard of excellent behavior. Of course no one's perfect, and many people have plenty of shame, low self-worth, and other qualities to grow out of. So long as people remain committed to being their best selves, acknowledging and learning from each mistake, they will walk a good path.

* having high expectations brings out the best in others -- people often rise or fall to the standards set for them. So if your friends ever tolerate less than your best, remind them you expect better from them.

* practice making promises to yourself and practice keeping them. When you sometimes break those promises, practice not feeling shame, but figuring out what lessons to learn so you can show up better in the future.

### Your Integrity is the Structure of your Culture

* Anyone can make agreements. What brings those agreements to life is upholding them. Having agreements and upholding them is what turns a collection of people into a community or a nation.

* Bravery -- do the right thing no matter what (see opening quotes in sacred masc chapter)
