Dorothy Parker once described, "The only dependable law of life -- everything is always worse than you thought it was going to be." I agree, except this isn't a law of life -- it's a law of unhealthy cultures. 

Selfishness and corruption are the same thing. So of course, in societies that systematically reward selfishness, there will be pervasive corruption, and no matter how much anybody investigates, there will always be more to find. Unhealthy cultures are rotten to the core, because all of them involve a few rulers exploiting many others and training them to tolerate it.

How are people trained to tolerate living in an unhealthy culture? And what qualities would they need to cultivate to have the strength to live in a healthy culture instead?

* _Sensitivity to abuse_: Instead of noticing abuse or exploitation and taking a stand to stop it, people are trained to ignore abuse, make excuses for it, blame low-privilege people for problems instead of the ruling class, or passively hope that the police will do something about it.

* _Remembering_: Everybody has ancestors who lived in healthy cultures, even if in the distant past, but most have forgotten and think their unhealthy culture is "just how life is."

* _Integrity_: Every human has an urge to stand for what's right in solidarity with others, but this isn't allowed in unhealthy cultures where people are expected to obey the law but not uphold it.

* _Bravery_: When the police punish anyone who tries to take a stand against abusive authorities, they arrest the bravest people, scaring the rest into holding back and tolerating abusive behavior. When people are scared into submission, and internally stop seeking ways to stand for what's right, they then prioritize their comfort and safety. Scaring people into submission trains them for cowardice.

* _Generosity_: Profit economies reward selfish, profit-seeking behavior rather than generosity.

* _Humility_: Unhealthy cultures often praise the rich and shame the poor, and train people to think that obedience makes people morally good, and disobedience morally bad. Humility may be mistaken for meekness or submissiveness, instead of the proper attitude of a strong public servant.   

* _Gratitude_: When people are not trained to receive the gifts of the Earth, it is easy not to feel grateful for the nonhumans and land and water, and instead ignore or exploit them.

* _Nature Connection_: Profit economies force people to seek money to survive, rather than build a mutually enriching relationship with the Earth.

* _Dignity_: Authoritarian religions train people to feel shame, disconnection from the divinity of life all around us, inherent badness or selfishness, displeasure, low self-worth, and other negative qualities rather than dignity, high self-worth, deep connection with people and nonhumans, and pleasure.

* _Deep awareness_: Unhealthy cultures often propagate hurtful racist or sexist assumptions, or rigid ideologies and dogmas about how life "should be," whether in economics, religion, politics, education, or anywhere else -- instead of training people for deep awareness.

* _Strong Children_: It is traumatic to live in a society which requires people to obey rulers' laws, and forbid people from taking a stand for what's right even while political, corporate, and religious authorities are obviously exploiting the rest. Traumatized parents can easily unintentionally traumatize their children, meaning emotional troubles are widespread in unhealthy cultures. This emotionally wounding is often reinforced in schools that train students to be obedient, and feel ashamed or bad if they disobey authorities. This is the opposite of training children to stand for what's right.

* _Trust_: Since low-integrity and selfishness are so widespread, many people can easily learn not to trust their neighbors, or be very guarded.

This deep unhealthy-culture training explains why, when a ruling class has suddenly lost power historically, oftentimes people have installed other rulers to lead them instead of taking the opportunity to build a healthy culture. People trained for distrust, cowardice, low integrity, selfishness, and disconnection from nature may not even believe humans could live in a healthy culture -- much less know how to create one.

These qualities of personal strength cannot be understated. When Haudenosaunee writers described their traditional way of life, they wrote, "universal justice is the product of a spiritually strong society, and many of [our] rules... are designed to create a strong society rather than a strong government." When everyone stands for what's right, the government responds to the people. When too few stand for what's right, unhealthy cultures result.

I believe all humans want to be in a culture where they can deeply trust their neighbors. What would it take for people to earn that depth of trust? For there to be deep trust, there also needs to be deep integrity, and the bravery to do what's right even when it's scary or hard. Deep trust requires widespread generosity instead of selfishness. Deep trust requires neighbors who seek the truth by cultivating awareness rather than making hurtful assumptions or clinging to rigid dogmas. I believe the path to building healthy cultures involves deep training in all these healthy-culture qualities. 

As Okanagan woman Jeannette Armstrong said, "The realization that people and community are there to sustain you creates the most secure feeling in the world..." Ultimately, I believe this deep trust comes when everyone in a group commits to acting in service of each other, and in service of the Earth.

### Instead of Fighting Symptoms Separately, What if Activists Addressed the Root Disease Together?

There is sexism in every unhealthy culture, and countless feminist movements have worked throughout history to fight sexism, and yet not a single feminist movement has ever ended sexism in their unhealthy culture.

The rich exploit the workers in every unhealthy culture, and countless labor activists have worked to stop exploitation of workers, and yet not a single labor movement has successfully ended the exploitation of workers in their society.

Some feminist groups have improved the treatment of women, just like some labor movements have improved wages or working conditions, at least somewhat. But no group in history has ever fully ended sexism or oppression of workers in their unhealthy culture.

The same is true for almost any cause:

* _Child sexual abuse_: Countless people have worked to end child abuse, and no social movement has ever ended child sexual abuse in their unhealthy culture.

* No _environmental movement_ has ever completely ended pollution or environmental destruction within their culture.

* No _anti-poverty movement_ has ever ended poverty in their society.

* No _nature connection movement_ has ever helped everyone in their society live in deep connection with the Earth.

* No _peace activists_ have ever made authorities permanently stop pushing for wars that serve the rich, or caused politicians to stop spreading lies and hate in support of war.

* No _anti-racism activists_ have ever fully ended racism in their unhealthy culture.

Activists may occasionally see some positive changes after years or decades of effort, but what would it take to have big, enduring victories and deep cultural change? The racism, sexism, disconnection from nature, widespread child abuse, environmental destruction, wars that serve the rich, and many other troubles are not actually different problems. They are merely symptoms of the same root cultural disease, where _a few people impose law on everybody else, and forbid people from upholding the laws they live by_.

As any doctor knows, treating a symptom will never actually lead to deep healing because the underlying disease persists. So long as activists treat racism, sexism, greed, child abuse, pollution, and political corruption as different problems, and allow rulers to persist, all these big troubles will tragically persist too and meaningful, enduring change will be elusive.

My dream is for feminists to join forces with people fighting racism, and for them to work with environmentalists, labor activists, and others. What if all these different activists didn't just fight separately against the symptoms, but also addressed the root cultural disease together and created new healthy cultures?

### The Deepest Revolution

In shallow revolutions, people overthrow their ruling class only to install new rulers. The ideologies might change, but the exploitation remains, and the lives of most people don't change much.

I believe the deepest revolution occurs when a group takes a stand together, creating their own laws to make a respectful society, and protecting themselves from any unhealthy cultures that might try to reconquer them. This was the Zapatistas' path. They did not march on the capital of Mexico and take over the country, which would have only made them rulers of an unhealthy culture. Instead they took a stand for their own laws and protected each other when the military attacked.

In a sense, the deepest revolution is simple: a group of people would simply need to make agreements with each other, and then have the integrity and bravery to uphold them. What agreements would they need to make? 

They would need to make agreements about how to protect themselves from selfish outsiders. They would need to agree on how to treat each other respectfully, and resolve disputes. They would need to make agreements about how to share, make decisions, and account for the needs of the Earth where they live.

Of course, this begs many questions. What would these agreements look like exactly? How could a group of deep integrity grow, cultivating trust between people who used to be strangers? How could people cultivate deep generosity in spite of the profit economy they live in? How could people learn how to receive the Earth's gifts in respectful ways, including fire, shelter, food, water, and life lessons? How could a group survive in the face of infiltrators and snitches?

There are no easy answers. Every person and group will find their own way. It helped me to find healthy cultures and people of unhealthy cultures who can teach by example. I collected many stories in _One Disease One Cure_ from healthy cultures around the world, showing how people maintain a way of life with widespread integrity, generosity, and dignity, all while living in reciprocity with nonhumans. There are also examples of people of unhealthy cultures acting with incredible bravery and integrity even knowing it might cost them their lives, including Harriet Tubman, Jesus Christ, and Martin Luther King Jr. Find the heroes and mentors who can inspire and teach practical lessons.

No agreements can account for everything either -- people will simply need to be flexible, and willing to keep standing for what's right as times change. The Zapatistas kept making adjustments to their leadership system long after their revolution in 1994, and almost 30 years later a Zapatista leader still said, "we are just learning and... it will take a while to get going well." So long as everyone maintains that attitude of service, that willingness to keep standing for what's right, they will find a good path.

I believe every human has what we need to live in a healthy culture. We are healthy cultures; each one of us has the same urges towards gratitude, integrity, sharing, and all the other beautiful qualities explored in this book. Every one of us has deep love to give, even if some have been trained to hold that love back. Every one of us can embrace and live these qualities at any time, generating healthy cultures or healthy subcultures everywhere we go.

I see each individual as a little potential healthy-subculture bubble. As these individuals find each other, they can form healthy subcultures together. The healthy-subculture bubbles can then grow and merge and grow even more, as open-hearted people keep finding each other, helping each other grow into their best selves and creating the kind of subculture they want to have. And when the group is ready to fully take a stand for each other and the Earth, they can create a sovereign healthy culture together.

My suggestion is: find a person to have this sort of deep connection with. Then find another. And then go from there.
