## Chapter 16: Build Spiritual Strength with Others

Can you imagine your life if you deeply trusted everyone around you to take care of each other and to stand for what's right no matter what?

Okanagan woman Jeannette Armstrong called this deep trust of knowing your community is there to sustain you "the most secure feeling in the world."[xxx-original instructions|armstrong]

People in healthy nations create and maintain this deep trust by consistently holding themselves and each other to high standards of respectful, generous, and cooperative behavior that benefits each individual because it benefits the group. People in healthy nations routinely expect themselves and others to behave with integrity, generosity, awareness, authenticity, physical resilience, joyfulness, personal growth and bravery. When qualities like deep integrity and generosity become widespread, it's easy to see how deep trust becomes widespread too.

So if those of us in unhealthy nations want to begin creating a new healthy nation, we must remember or relearn how to hold ourselves and each other to high standards too.

### Healthy Nations Show How High our Standards Can Be

_Integrity:_ In every legal system around the world, people are required to testify under oath, and they are threatened with severe punishment for lying. The assumption is that participants might lie if they weren't scared.

In contrast, integrity was so pervasive among the traditional Apache that they did not compel anyone to take an oath because, according to Geronimo, "it is not believed that they will give false testimony in a matter relating to their own people."[xxx-geronimo autobio|Unwritten Laws of the Apaches]

Can you imagine if there was no need for an oath to tell the truth, because people in your group already expected total honesty from each other as a normal way of life?

_Physical resilience:_ Crow woman Pretty Shield described how physically resilient her people were when they lived in a traditional way. She said, "Ahh, my people were tough in those days... [W]hen I was young, if in winter a person fell into icy water, he got out, took off his wet clothes, and rolled in the snow, rubbing his body with it, and got warm. Then, after squeezing out the water, he put on his clothes and forgot about getting wet... Now my people wear gloves, and too many clothes. We are soft as mud."[xxx-red mother|p84]

Can you imagine if the people around you were so physically resilient that even being soaking wet in winter was nothing to worry about, but just a little trouble to fix?

_Generosity:_ A Christian missionary once visited men of the Ojibway, Cheyenne, Cree and Sioux nations, and he described Jesus Christ's selfless generosity. Christ gave away all his possessions and urged others to do the same while dedicating his life to feeding, healing, and protecting his people. The missionary was told that, prior to colonization, Jesus Christ's level of selfless generosity was simply normal among them.[xxx-from deep woods to civilization|civ preached practiced]

Can you imagine living in a nation where someone like Jesus Christ was considered admirable but not unusual because such selfless generosity is simply normal and expected?

_Meaningful Education for Young People:_ One Nootka storyteller described how the women would often have their moon time at the same time each month, and they would go to a special house and enjoy a four-day party. They would sit on special soft moss and give their blood back to the Earth and play games and talk. Women would rub each others' back and make special tea if someone had cramps. This became a major opportunity for older women to mentor younger women. For example, young women learned the special Frog posture that could help relieve cramps and make childbirth easier.

Can you imagine if adults took young people's education seriously, offering them the most meaningful mentorship they could every day?

_Benefitting the Earth:_ Stories abound of people of healthy nations actually benefitting the Earth as a normal way of life rather than depleting it. Robin Kimmerer described how Black Ash trees actually became _more abundant_ in regions where it was respectfully harvested by Mohawk and Potawatomi basket makers, and this remains true today.[xxx-braiding sweetgrass|wisgaak gokpenagen] Apache man Stalking Wolf described how he respectfully harvested a sapling to make a bow so that the overall forest benefitted, and the chosen tree yielded a powerful bow.[xxx-the vision|p81]

Can you imagine if your normal way of life benefitted the Earth around you, increasing the natural abundance that you depend on?

When people bring out the best in each other, have high expectations, or hold each other to high standards, we really are capable of maintaining that baseline of mutual respect among each other, and between people and the Earth.

Remember, members of nations such as the Potawatomi, Ojibway, Apache, and Nootka are people like anyone else. They have attitudes, skills and awareness that anyone could cultivate -- including you and the people around you.

Regardless of the unhealthy nation in which you may now live, you can hold yourself and others to a high standard of integrity. You and the people around you could cultivate physical resilience, mentor young people in a good way, and learn how to receive the Earth's gifts in a way that actually benefits the Earth.

This is the path to building a culture of deep trust. Have high expectations for yourself and the people around you so that qualities like integrity, bravery, awareness, and generosity are simply normal and expected.

<div class="rev-act"><div class="rev-act-header">Revolutionary Activity #26<br/>Hold yourself and others to a high standard</div>
<div class="rev-act-body">Think of a time when someone had faith in you, maybe even more faith than you had in yourself. Did someone help you find the self-respect to leave an abusive romantic relationship? Did a coach help you cultivate the discipline to train at your sport and be the best you could be? Did a teacher help you realize you could be great at whatever you put your mind to? If this mentor did their job properly, they did not shame or punish you, but helped you see your unmet potential and urged you to reach it -- to be your best self, and not settle for less. Think of an example like this where someone really brought out the best in you, holding you to a high standard.<br/><br/>Watch for an instance where someone lets themselves or others down. Perhaps they lie to someone or to themselves, or give up on a big goal too easily, or tolerate an unsatisfying relationship or job without even trying to change it. One way or another, help them find the strength to show up better.</div></div>

<div class="rev-act-body">Oftentimes, when one person feels upset by another, they'll express themselves but not communicate very clearly or very respectfully. Whenever someone expresses anger or frustration with you, or offers you constructive feedback, actively look for the lesson to learn so that you can grow from the experience. Repeat the lesson back to them, to ensure both you and the other person agree on it. This ensures you heard them properly, and that you only learn lessons that you agree with. Do what you can to make it easy rather than difficult for others to give you constructive feedback if they see you making a mistake.</div></div>

#### Seeing the Trap of Low Standards

When people are conquered, they may be tempted to accept their own submissive obedience as legitimate and normal. When a person or group tolerates their own obedient submission, they stop expecting much of themselves or others. People don't really expect life to be deeply meaningful, or don't trust others, or learn to focus mostly on themselves or pleasing others instead of standing for what's right. People may engage in superficial or wishful thinking, and may even adopt the ideologies of their abusers.

Widespread low standards and low expectations have many tragic consequences for both men and women.

One of the biggest examples of low standards is clear in a single question I keep hearing: _where are all the good men?_ In feminist literature around the world, this is a common question going back to the dawn of unhealthy nations.[xxx-odoc|ch47]

For years, I didn't understand the question, "where are all the good men?" I didn't know what a good man was until I studied healthy nations where boys are consistently raised to be good men who stand for what's right and bravely protect their people from harm. Stories of profoundly trustworthy men and trusting women from the Crow, Cheyenne, and Lakota showed me that all the men of a nation can be trustworthy.[xxx-odoc|ch47]

A core masculine gift is that of setting boundaries, especially protecting one's people from threats. In all nations, few things inspire men more than the need to protect their people from danger. And yet, in unhealthy nations, the rulers are the greatest threat to the people. The greatest threat is not from outside; it is within the nation itself, and neither men nor women are allowed to do anything about that.

Abusive nations raise boys not to honor their innate spiritual calling to protect their people from threats as a gift of love, without any compensation or orders. Instead, men commonly grow up learning to tolerate, ignore, or perpetuate abuse. People may join the police or military, but they just have to follow orders too.

When boys are raised to deny or twist this deep love-gift of boundary-setting and protection, unhealthy nations wind up with deeply spiritually confused men who ask questions like "When does life become meaningful?" or "Why am I even here?"

This explains the spiritual meaning behind Henry David Thoreau's comment that "The mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation."[xxx-walden|economy] It also explains the famous statement that "Every man dies. Not every man really lives."[xxx-braveheart every man] Living a life where a person has learned to hold back their love, afraid to stand for what's right, is deeply unsatisfying.

Of course, women can set boundaries and protect their people too. And yet, when this protective boundary-setting is forbidden in unhealthy nations, many men become spiritually lost, struggling to know how to live in a deeply satisfying way.

People endlessly debate the meaning of "toxic masculinity," and this perspective gets to the heart of the trouble: unhealthy nations do not train boys to be good men, because good men stand for what's right and protect their people from any threat, and authorities forbid this. Boys learn to cope with this deep trouble in a variety of ways. Some become selfish or become people pleasers, or distract themselves from their meaningless life with things like alcohol, drugs, superficial hobbies, or overwork.

Women in unhealthy nations may become spiritually lost too, such as those who believe women can be "liberated" by becoming well-paid wage slaves, selfish executives and corrupt politicians, just like spiritually lost men.

Instead of seeking real freedom, authorities in unhealthy nations trick men and women into thinking that "freedom" means being able to do whatever you want without financial restraint, and so the way to become free is to get rich. But this is the faux-freedom of kings who don't care about anyone.

Real freedom comes when everyone cares for and protects each other and stands for what's right as a normal way of life, so that everyone can enjoy justice and deep respect with their neighbors. When people forget this and just look after themselves, it's easy to become spiritually lost and let selfishness take over.

I certainly do _not_ suggest anyone quit their job. Just realize that individuals trying to get better-paying jobs is not the path to collective freedom. 

Revolutionaries like the Black Panthers and Zapatistas often kept working their jobs to support themselves as they sought to free their people. Black Panther Don Cox put it well: "use what you got to get what you need."[xxx-just another nigger|use what you got] Making money and getting rich shouldn't be the end-goal. Just like the Tzutujil Mayans and Huron who liked to get rich so they could give it all away, or Harriet Tubman who saved up money so she could return South to help others escape chattel slavery, I support people in making money so they can do the most good in service of the people and nonhumans they love.

When you know what to look for, you will see how low our expectations are for each other in unhealthy nations. But it doesn't need to be this way. To create healthy communities and eventually sovereign healthy nations, we need to raise our standards!

#### Everything is a Skill that Can be Practiced Without Guilt or Shame

Feelings like shame or guilt are some of the biggest obstacles to deep personal growth. They can also make a person resistant to receiving feedback from others, making it difficult for people to hold each other to high standards of behavior. People can resist feedback because they don't want to be unfairly shamed or made to feel guilty. Even if the feedback is respectful, people can have subconscious shame or guilt from their childhood that gets triggered, and they can become defensive.

Thus, to really hold yourself and others to a high standard and help people grow when they make a mistake, it is crucial to learn how to pursue personal and collective growth without shame or guilt.

The first requirement is to have the attitude that, when someone lets you down, they are a _good person making a mistake_, not a bad person being themselves. Trust that they want to show up in a good way and just don't know how -- there's something they're missing, but if they could see it, they would grow and show up well.

Some people are so stuck that they don't grow even with repeated respectful feedback, and you may need to set boundaries and not allow their hurtful behavior in your life anymore. But if someone acts hurtfully and you start with the attitude that they're "bad," they will be resistant to any feedback that you offer.

Trusting in people's inherent goodness helps me see that everything in life is a skill that can be practiced without guilt or shame.

<div class="rev-act"><div class="rev-act-header">Revolutionary Activity #28<br/>Learn without guilt or shame</div>
<div class="rev-act-body">Think of a time you made a mistake and someone made you feel guilty or shameful in response. How much harder did those feelings make it to learn from your mistake? How helpful would it have been if the person trusted that you wanted to learn, and just helped you grow from the experience? Next time you make a mistake, practice learning what you can while noticing any feelings of guilt or shame and just letting them go.</div></div>

#### Practice Makes Progress

Think back to a skill you learned as a child. Imagine, for example, that you learned to play soccer, including smaller skills such as how to dribble or pass the ball. To get better at passing, what did you do?

You practiced: you tried your best to kick the soccer ball to someone, and sometimes the ball went where you intended and sometimes it didn't. When you kicked the ball in the wrong direction, you figured out what lesson to learn, hopefully without any shame, and then practiced passing the ball with those new lessons in mind. The more you practiced, the more lessons you learned, and the more proper technique became normal and engrained. If you approached all aspects of soccer this way, eventually you became a skilled soccer player.

Living with integrity, awareness, gratitude, and generosity are skills too, and you can practice each of these intentionally just like any other skill. Practice approaching life with these qualities, and notice when you show up with them and when you don't. Perhaps sometimes you don't have the awareness you want, or you are afraid to tell the truth and so you lie instead.

Cultivating these qualities is just like learning to kick a soccer ball. When you mess up, avoid any sense of guilt or shame. Just recognize that you made a mistake, learn from it, and do better next time. If you hurt or disappointed someone else, acknowledge your mistake, do your best to make it right, learn whatever lessons you can, and commit to doing better. And if you feel any residual guilt or shame, let it go. You are just practicing and learning.

And just like you practice kicking a soccer ball before the game, you can practice these beautiful qualities outside the normal flow of life. Take bravery for example, which is the ability to remain conscious and do what you know in your heart is right even if you feel uncomfortable or afraid. To practice bravery, you can intentionally put yourself in uncomfortable or scary situations and practice maintaining your composure. If you're scared of dancing, face your fear and go dancing. If cold water feels uncomfortable, practice keeping your composure in cold water. Learn to feel _comfortable in the midst of discomfort_ so that nothing causes you to ever "hold back" or "shut down" parts of yourself.

The book _One Disease One Cure_ contains many more suggestions for cultivating bravery, integrity, and other qualities.[xxx-odoc]

Spiritual growth can be joyful rather than stressful when you approach it without shame and guilt, as part of a group of friends that bring out the best in each other. So long as you're truly committed to that path of spiritual growth, mistakes are simply learning opportunities along the way.

In my personal life, when I really embraced this attitude, my rate of growth increased. I started learning life lessons faster than before because I wasn't wasting time feeling shame and guilt. I just noticed my mistakes, learned from them, and moved on.

<div class="rev-act"><div class="rev-act-header">Revolutionary Activity #29<br/>Practice bravery</div>
<div class="rev-act-body">Think of a fear that you're avoiding right now. You may have lied to someone and you're afraid of owning up to it, or you're afraid of quitting an unsatisfying job or asking an attractive person on a date. Face your fear, recognize that you can handle whatever comes, and do the thing you're afraid to do.</div></div>

#### Building a Healthy Community Starts with You

Like a healthy nation, in a healthy community people have high standards for themselves and others so that integrity, generosity, care for the Earth, respect for children, and other beautiful qualities are widespread and normal. When you complete the revolutionary activities, you will be we ll on your way to building a healthy community with others.

You've practiced standing for what's right and supporting others when they take a stand. You've practiced giving generously and receiving graciously. You've practiced cultivating gratitude, giving your sacred gifts, and forming relationships of reciprocity where people share with each other over time.

You've practiced receiving the Earth's gifts with gratitude, and giving back to the Earth. You've questioned your assumptions, practiced bravery, and channeled your anger in productive ways.

You've joined with other people into groups that continually share with each other, and where people can safely speak their heart. You've practiced holding yourself and others to high standards and making it easy for others to do the same for you.

If you haven't completed all the activities yet, that's ok! These are life-long practices, meant to be done over and over until they become a way of life. If you haven't started, that's ok too. Now is a good time to start.

#### Build a Healthy Community by Building Spiritual Strength with Others

A great way to begin building a healthy community, and eventually a healthy nation, is to build the _most amazing friendships ever._

What kind of friends do you want to have? Do you want friends who have your back no matter what, who share and support you and always tell the truth, who care about the Earth and enjoy life? If you want friends like that, what kind of friend would you need to be?

Of course -- you'd need to be that kind of friend too.

There are so many people that want friendships like this. Whether you meet people online, at shops, at political events, anarchist spaces, in your neighborhood, or just by chance, many people long for such beautiful relationships, and they will be glad to meet you.

Find others who also want rich friendships, and practice the revolutionary activities together. When you make a good friend, practice supporting each other, sharing, standing for what's right, holding each other to a high standard, encouraging each person to give their sacred gifts, and cultivating bravery. Practice purposely creating surveillance-free spaces without any recording devices present so you can have privacy.

Deep friendships usually take time to grow, but they will grow a lot faster if you have a clear intention for the kind of friendship you want to have, and the kind of friend you want to be.

Many people have little time and energy to develop deep friendships due to all kinds of stressors, such as keeping their job, rearing children, and worrying about politics. Find ways to share your time and energy so that overworked parents can have some time away from kids without resorting to electronic "babysitters," or so people can feel resilient if their job goes away. If someone lives in a food desert, help them get fresh produce. If someone can't afford fresh produce, help them find a worktrade opportunity so they don't need to pay to eat well.

Have fun together -- go on camping trips and ask each person to bring a story to share around the fire, make music in someone's living room, and celebrate milestones in kids' lives, like their first step or first successful hunt.

Build up each other's dignity. Train self-defense and bravery together. Help each other remember what's important in life -- taking care of each other and the Earth. Being around excellent and beautiful people is the best antidote I know for the endless superficiality and corruption in the news and entertainment shows.

Build spiritual strength together, with each person bringing out the best in everyone else. When you help each other and the Earth, living with high standards for yourself and each other, you will become more than a group of friends. You will become a healthy community, choosing your own beautiful way of life together despite the laws and pressures of your unhealthy nation.

This is the difference between a friend group or collection of neighbors and a healthy community. Friends and neighbors may enjoy each other's company, but they may not have the same values and usually don't have their own high standards of behavior for each other. In healthy communities, whether people are neighbors or they're more spread out, people do share many of the same values and, most importantly, they hold themselves and each other to high standards.

As a healthy community of people holding each other to high standards, your group's standards of appropriate behavior will become the laws you live by -- laws based not on dominance, exploitation and selfishness but on justice, respect, generosity, dignity, kindness, and bravery.

The Haudenosaunee writers described how their "society was founded on concepts of moral justice, not statute law."[xxx-a basic call to consciousness|p38] Such a society can only exist when everyone has that spiritual strength to stand for what's right. And building new healthy communities where people joyfully cultivate that spiritual strength together is part of the path to building new healthy nations.

Whether you're protecting a forest or river from destruction or pollution, or enriching the soil or creating new bird habitat, find a practical way with others to give back to the nonhumans who give us humans so much.</div></div>

#### Build a Nation One Community at a Time, and Build a Community One Person at a Time

Healthy nations are built on healthy communities where people have deep relationships with each other and the Earth. The Zapatistas showed me how to build a nation one community at a time.

Instead of instituting a new overarching government, even after their revolution, they said clearly that the communities are "the core of all autonomy." They created higher levels of councils to help the communities protect each other, communicate, and share resources, but no "higher ups" interfere in the communities' business.[xxx-ezln new structure] Top-level leaders really are merely conduits for the will of the people, not dictators.

In order for this way of life to work, healthy communities needed to exist in the first place where people hold themselves and others to high standards so they can deeply trust each other. Mexican towns already existed before the revolution, but with corrupt leaders and divisive politics, they were not suitable places to discuss how to have a new healthy nation.

To help form new healthy communities, the Zapatistas traveled around to meet people face to face. Major Ana Maria described secretly hosting study sessions where people discussed how they could organize, learn and contribute.[xxx-bringing women in ezln]

Zapatista women commanders Ramona and Susana traveled to dozens of communities where they read out the proposed Revolutionary Women's Law to women's groups. A women's group in each community gave feedback and ultimately had to approve the law to ensure that women would be fully respected in this new nation. Thousands of indigenous women were consulted.[xxx-everyday heroism makes the sparkles possible]<sup>,</sup>[xxx-opendemocracy zapatista women law as it is lived today]

How could the women have offered feedback and given their consent if the women's groups didn't exist in the first place? How could the study sessions have formed if everyone in a given town were selfishly focused on their own life, and didn't care about building a healthy nation with others?

If the communities of receptive people didn't exist, there would have been no one for the organizers to consult with or build a nation with. The respectful communities had to exist before they could be united into a respectful nation.

These healthy communities are simply groups of people that have their own agreements on how to live well together. They still live under ruling-class laws, but despite that, they have their own standards and choose their own way of life the best they can based on all the principles in this book, including integrity, deep connection with the Earth, and generosity.

The Zapatistas described how these healthy communities were absolutely essential for their revolution.

Commander Ramona and major Ana Maria went to live in the jungle with dedicated revolutionaries in the 1980s, where they learned key skills like hunting and fighting and gained political consciousness. They joined around the age of 12 or 13, but accepted responsibilities as full adults and were obviously held to very high standards. At the age of 25, Ana Maria successfully lead about a thousand people in a military assault to free a town from Mexican rule and Ramona directed the resulting peace negotiations.[xxx-ezln ramona san crist]<sup>,</sup>[xxx-opendemocracy zapatista women law as it is lived today]

Many other Zapatistas didn't change their lives as radically as these women did; they seemed to live normal lives in Mexico but they still supported the revolution, and Ana Maria said these people played a vital role. The full-time revolutionaries had to have the support of the people to address challenges like helping them move around, get supplies, recruit, and blend in. Without the support of healthy communities of people who already had deep relationships with each other and the Earth, the revolution would have failed.

What would happen if there was a revolutionary movement to create a new healthy nation, and a representative came to your region? Would there be a community of people who are already receptive to what he or she has to say because they've already been cultivating deep relationships with each other and the Earth, and they already know they want to live in a healthy nation? If the representative hosted a study session, would anybody come? Or would the representative move on, seeking more receptive people to collaborate with?

It might seem hopeless to just gather a group of 5 or 10 people willing to build a different way of life together, adopting the healthy-nation perspectives in this book. Sure, you could be good to each other and serve the Earth locally, but maybe it seems impossible to form enough trust relationships to build a nation of many thousands or more.

But if you can help create a community of 5, 10, or 50 people, it will be part of the fertile ground from which the Deepest Revolution will sprout. When organizers come around to recruit, offer training, give and receive mutual aid, and seek input on what the new nation's laws should be, any community you help build will play an important role. And that community must exist first.

This is what it means to _build a healthy nation one community at a time_. When you can form deep friendships with other people around you, who are committed to supporting each other and the Earth, bringing out the best in each other and living a meaningful life every day, you're forming a little healthy community where trust and gratitude are the norm, because integrity and generosity and mutual aid are normal too.

When people feel isolated and scared, even if they don't like the corruption of their unhealthy nation, they will support and protect their unhealthy nation because it offers them stability and some measure of safety and comfort. Their friends and family are all part of the unhealthy nation, and all their hopes and dreams are tied up in it. When a revolution occurs, people who don't have those deep relationships will easily be convinced that their way of life is under attack, and they will fight the revolutionaries.

If you can form a little community that embraces these healthy-nation practices of deep solidarity and generosity, the people in your group won't be isolated anymore. Scary things might happen, but nobody in the community will face them alone. When people can orient to this community of deep relationships, they will have less motivation to protect their unhealthy nation in order to protect themselves. Instead they will enjoy that most secure feeling in the world when they trust their community to protect them.

Over time if we can form enough healthy communities, someday they may unite to form a healthy nation, or even many nations. 

So work with others to form a healthy community, making it as beautiful as you can while living under the imposed laws of your unhealthy nation. Even if nothing bigger ever happens, it will be good and worth the effort. And if the time is ever ripe for all the communities to come together to form a sovereign healthy nation, the community you help build will have an important role to play.

#### Hold Good Boundaries to Keep Selfishness Out**

Many people don't learn to hold good boundaries in unhealthy nations because their laws are imposed on them and they're not allowed to uphold the laws they live by. People can learn to tolerate inappropriate behavior towards themselves, or act hurtfully towards others and not notice or not care.

For many people, selfishness seems normal and unremarkable, but it is a poison for healthy communities and nations. To avoid selfishness, your community must learn to hold good boundaries.

Many people are not ready to live in healthy community for various reasons. Some people won't see the value in healthy communities. Infiltrators will pretend to want community but actually try to sabotage it. Others will want community but aren't really committed to the depth of personal growth needed to show up in a good way. These people need to be prevented from joining the community, or evicted if they are allowed in, at least until they are willing to change their ways.

Other people honestly want to live in a healthy community, but they've learned bad habits and sometimes they act hurtfully. But they are committed to personal growth, and when they are approached respectfully they change their ways and show up better.

Some of the deepest work of building healthy communities is learning when to forgive and when to hold good boundaries and evict someone whose continued misbehavior threatens the whole community's honest and generous way of life.

If you don't hold boundaries and just let anyone participate, selfish people will push out the generous ones and the community will not last. Also, if you commonly evict people for any thoughtless or hurtful act or momentary subconscious selfishness, then everyone will feel vulnerable and afraid to make a mistake and the community will still not last.

It must be ok to make a mistake and trust that people will know you're willing to learn and make amends. At the same time it is important to have high standards of behavior that everybody is continuously striving to meet, and if someone isn't actually committed to those high standards, they must leave for the good of the community.

Plenty of people have lied or broken promises to me, and I had to decide if I would to trust them again. The question I ask is this: "Are they clearly committed to personal growth so that, if they are shown their hurtful behavior and how to show up better, they will grow from it and not make the same mistake again?"

If someone makes a mistake and I respectfully confront them, what happens? If they make excuses or attack me, then I hold a strong boundary and refuse to trust them. If they acknowledge their mistake, apologize, try to make up for it, and truly commit to doing better, then I trust them, maybe even more than before. When this kind of counseling goes well, it helps the person cultivate a deeper self-awareness and integrity, and helps us both trust that we can work through troubles when they arise.

This allows people a _path back to grace._ With so many people in unhealthy nations developing bad habits and subconscious hurtful behaviors, people are going to make a lot of mistakes and act hurtfully without knowing it. You will need to be ready.

People cannot be afraid that any one slip-up will cause them to be kicked out. There has to be a path back to grace so that people who act hurtfully or violate people's trust can return to being trusted if they truly show that they can honor that trust again.

So learn when to forgive and when to hold good boundaries to keep unwelcome people out. This may sound hard, but it is part of the art of being human, and in a healthy community no single person makes these decisions alone.

Even the Zapatistas make mistakes. Major Moisés described their self-governance changes and said that "we are just learning and... it will take a while to get going well."[xxx-ezln new structure]

This is why it's so important to cultivate dignity together -- making your own laws and choosing how to uphold them (i.e. holding people to a high standard of behavior) is a big responsibility. You'll make mistakes too as you learn how to have a healthy community.

So commit to that path of deep spiritual growth with other people. Expect that mistakes will happen, and learn to grow from them and forgive. Learn to hold healthy boundaries too so that, one way or another, selfishness will not take hold in your healthy community.

#### Building a Healthy Nation is Hard -- But We Are Healthy Nations

Building a healthy nation is challenging. In unhealthy nations, we have a way of life that encourages superficiality, ineffective political movements, division, deceit, and selfishness. Many people learn to feel helpless or not care about anything, as their society seems so sick and there's no clear path of deep change.

It would be hard enough to grow up surrounded by these hurtful qualities and then embrace a way of life based on integrity, generosity, and deep connection instead. It becomes immensely harder when authorities sabotage solidarity, train people for obedience, spread lies, murder spiritual leaders, abuse children, and keep people in poverty.

The Zapatistas showed that the path to freedom will be difficult and dangerous, yet every one of them chose to walk it so they could escape this terrible way of life and create a healthy nation instead. And you could walk a similar path.**

You can help form new healthy communities with real solidarity despite all the challenges, where people share generously and stand for what's right for each other and the Earth, knowing each person has the others' backs no matter what.**

Despite centuries of oppression, this truth remains: Being treated with care and respect, feeding others and being fed, meeting life's needs with meaningful work, and living closely with open-hearted people feels wonderful. It feels so incredibly wonderful because _this is who we really are._**

We are healthy nations; each one of us has the same urges towards gratitude, integrity, sharing, and all the other beautiful qualities described in this book, even if some people have learned to ignore those urges in order to survive in their unhealthy nation.

So spread the good news! Healthy nations do exist, and for those of us trapped in unhealthy nations, it doesn't need to be this way. Cultivate your spiritual strength, and build deep relationships with other people and the Earth.

Perhaps you will someday live in a free nation, or perhaps you will lay the groundwork so that a future generation can. Even if you're just good to the Earth and the people around you right now, it'll be worth it. No matter what happens, spreading the good news, building your spiritual strength, and giving your gifts will make the world a brighter place.
