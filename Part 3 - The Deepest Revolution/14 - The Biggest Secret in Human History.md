## Chapter 14: The Biggest Secret in Human History

What do you think is the biggest secret in human history?

What secret has been kept from billions of people across every continent going back centuries or even millennia?

The most widespread and ancient secret is this: you, and everybody else in the whole world, could potentially live in nations that maintain a respectful way of life among the people, and between the people and the Earth. Many nations around the world, now and in the recent past, show that this is not just possible, but the normal and healthy way for humans to live.

Why has this been such an epic, widely-kept secret? Of course: Ruling classes have done their best -- around the world and throughout history -- to prevent people from learning that free societies exist, so that their conquered subjects will not know what freedom is like, or won't believe in freedom at all.

For thousands of years, wage slaves, chattel slaves, and other slaves have been kept ignorant of the existence of free nations, or they've been trained to misunderstand them. 

When you know what to look for, the history books show this vividly.

Just as the American, German, and other authorities are falsely calling anti-genocide protesters "antisemitic" today and using that as an excuse to punish them for opposing their rulers' genocide, for centuries European colonial authorities likewise have falsely called people of healthy nations "ignorant", "savages," "uneducated," and "the antichrist." Centuries of lies and manipulation in North and South America, Africa, Australia, and around the world trained conquered people to fear and hate free people of healthy nations instead of seeing them as potential mentors, allies, and friends. Chapter 2 showed that sometimes the secret got out, and some colonists did indeed run away to live in freedom with healthy nations.

Why would ruling classes work so hard to spread propaganda against healthy nations? David Mantell, author of the _True Americanism_ study, said it clearly: "It is difficult to live in a permanent state of rebellion, and rebellions rarely occur when people do not have standards of comparison or do not see the chance of changing their circumstances."[xxx-true americanism|p27]

In other words, ruling classes try to keep people in despair, not knowing that another way of life is possible without endless troubles like corruption and greed.

But now you know the secret: _healthy nations do exist,_ whole nations that maintain a baseline of respect internally because everybody stands for what's right, and nobody rules over anybody else. And their existence is proof that it's possible to live in a beautiful way, without all the cultural and political problems that can seem "just the way life is."

Most people either haven't heard of healthy nations or they misunderstand them, so they have no standard of comparison, and they're likely to accept their unhealthy nation as "good enough." British prime minister Winston Churchill even said, "democracy is the worst form of government except for all those other forms that have been tried..."[xxx-churchill democracy]

Of course, if you believe the only alternative to authoritarian democracy is being ruled by a king, priest or imam, then you'll do your best to make democracy "work."

But what if you learned what freedom is like by studying actually-free people? And what if you found plenty of examples from today or recent times, including case studies of successful revolutionary movements?

What if you realized how much your unhealthy nation had trained you and your ancestors to hold back your deepest love and tolerate endless abusive behavior all around you?

And what if you could see that it doesn't need to be this way, that you and people around you could unite to create a new nation where respect is the norm?

At that moment, everything changes. _The secret is out!_

Once you know what healthy nations are like, you have that standard of comparison. You can see that _voting will never lead to deep change because slaves have never voted their way to freedom._ You can see that endless TV debates between left and right, liberals and conservatives, and capitalists and socialists are all merely a distraction from the conversations that might lead to the Deepest Revolution.

Instead of engaging in endless political debates that have never helped people find freedom, what if you imagined the kind of world you wanted to live in? And what if you worked with others to bring your vision to life?

### Imagine...

Imagine a life where every moment feels alive, you are surrounded by people you trust, and you are free to contribute to your community in the most meaningful ways without worrying if it pays well or at all.

Imagine a world with no police or prisons, where no one worries about crime because you know that if anyone misbehaves or threatens you, all your friends and neighbors will come to your aid. Just like you would for them.

Imagine having enough time with your kids and having enough time to make their education really excellent, so that every day is meaningful and engaging for them. Imagine training children for qualities like deep generosity, awareness, bravery, connection, and joy so that these become normal parts of their lives and pervasive in your nation.

Imagine no boring classes, no unaccountable school authorities, and no meaningless work and tests that train children for meaningless work in adulthood. Instead, imagine being a teenager and being treated so respectfully that there is nothing to rebel against!

Imagine going through a process where your nation chooses a leader, and people like Jesus Christ or Martin Luther King Jr are selected!

Imagine finding your childhood innocence again, joyfully offering your deepest love in each moment surrounded by other people giving theirs. Because of course no one loses their innocence. When people embrace hurtful qualities like shame, low self-worth, or selfishness, and learn to hold back their deepest love, _people forget their innocence_.

And anything that's been forgotten can be remembered again.

Can you imagine if people took care of their neighborhoods instead of letting it get trashy, as people with dignity and self-respect likewise respect the space where they live?

Imagine working with your neighbors to take care of everybody's needs together, so you need not worry about health care, retirement, having enough to eat or having shelter.

And you don't need to work an unsatisfying job to maybe have enough money to pay for it all!

Imagine seeing the Earth's gifts and people's gifts everywhere you look, and feeling a continuous state of joyful gratitude for all of life's blessings.

Imagine feeling indebted because your neighbors give you so much that you constantly feel the urge to give back, with the endless sharing just adding to the joyful feeling of indebtedness. Who would want to wipe clean such happy debts?

Imagine befriending animals like the deer and bear, trees like the chestnuts and hickories, and herbs like stinging nettle and chickweed, and learning how to feed their communities just as they feed yours. Imagine knowing the plants and animals so intimately that you increase their populations even as you respectfully harvest some to eat.

No one can predict or control the future. Times of sickness or hunger might come, or war and migration. Imagine trusting that the people around you will take care of you, just like you'll take care of them. Imagine relaxing into that "realization that people and community are there to sustain you [which] creates the most secure feeling in the world..."[xxx-original instructions|armstrong]

_This is not theoretical or idealistic, and I am not making this up. Every scene you just imagined came directly from a story or observation from real people like you and me in an actual healthy nation._

This incredible vision is not a fantasy. You and other people can bring this vision to life.

### Will You Bring Your Vision to Life or Will you Forget It?

All these things you just imagined created a beautiful vision. You could work with other people to bring your vision to life, or you could forget it.

I want to tell you the story of someone who forgot, because the story showed me how easy it is to forget, and it taught me how to keep a beautiful vision alive.

I know someone who, in the early 1990s, thought about whether it was ok for the US to invade Iraq. She had never engaged in politics much, but as the United States invaded, she wondered, is the US really invading to bring democracy like the politicians say? Or is the real purpose to take Iraq's oil? Is it ok to kill people to take oil?

These were very deep questions!

Unfortunately, she was unable to find other people to share her concerns with and speak her heart. Her husband and many friends were involved with the war and seemed unwilling to question it. She was surrounded by people but still felt alone, unable to discuss her concerns and fears, and unable to consider how to respond with others.

Over time, she became more stressed, and she and her husband began speaking of divorce. She had the career and family of her dreams but was unhappy and felt stuck and alone. Finally, she decided to take antidepressants, which allowed her to numb the feeling of dissatisfaction without bravely responding to it. And she stopped asking such deep questions about her unhealthy nation.

It can be easy to feel trapped and unable to respond to one's frustrations and fears, and many people cope by numbing their feelings with endless distractions, such as screen addiction, focusing on superficial things, antidepressants, drug and alcohol abuse, studying religious dogma, or overworking. These are simply ways people learn to "hold back" or "shut down" parts of themselves to avoid feeling their own dissatisfaction when they don't see a way to meaningfully respond.

This showed me how easy it can be to forget who we really are, to stop asking deep questions and stop believing deep change is possible. It also taught me the path to continually remembering and keeping a vision alive: _share your vision with other people_.

So find people that you trust to speak your heart to, and whom you likewise listen to. When you can speak clearly with thoughtful, caring people in private, they will help you remember that you are sane, and it's your unhealthy nation that is crazy!
