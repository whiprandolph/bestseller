## Chapter 11: The Endless Predation Must End

Sioux man Sitting Bull said, "The life of white men is slavery. They are prisoners in their towns or farms." At first I thought he was exaggerating. How can even middle-class people be prisoners?

Well, just as prisoners have no influence over how the prison rules are enforced, the vast majority of people in any unhealthy culture have no influence over how the laws are enforced. And just as prisoners have little influence on what happens in the cell across the hall, the vast majority of citizens, when they behave obediently, have little influence over what happens around them. And when huge numbers of people resign themselves to tolerating predatory behavior instead of standing for what's right, abuse and exploitation become extremely common.

Child sexual abuse runs rampant in these settings. Researchers in Germany, Ireland, the USA and Australia have found many thousands of child sexual abuse victims from Catholic priests in each country. One investigation in France alone found over 216,000 child sexual assault victims between 1950-2020. Universally, higher Catholic Church authorities covered up or stalled investigations into the abusive priests.

Child rape can become quite normalized. One boy was raped by monks in Buddhist Tibet and complained to other monks. He said, "they shrugged and said simply that that was just the way things were."

Many secular authority figures have also raped children, and few have faced any accountability at all -- clearly too few to deter any others. Famous British media personality Jimmy Savile raped dozens of underaged people as young as 8 years old from the 1960s-1980s, and British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) staff evicted from the premesis young women who complained of his inappropriate behavior.

An orphanage in Portugal was revealed to house a huge child sexual abuse operation in 2002, although the police and the Portuguese president were notified of the abuses by several boys in 1980. Several low-ranking men were prosecuted, but none of the wealthy international clients who flew in to spend time with the boys faced justice. Of course, the police and politicians who "failed" to investigate likewise went unpunished.

In the late 1980s in Omaha, Nebraska, a child sexual abuse operation was discovered based in the child foster care system. Investigators found child sexual abuse victims who named many powerful politicians as abusers, including regional judges, politicians, and business executives. Possibly the most powerful person named as an abuser was president George HW Bush, who also had been vice president and director of the CIA, making him one of the most powerful people in the world. Fifteen knowledgeable people died violent deaths during the investigation, and none of the perpetrators faced justice.

Nothing occurred in any of these cases to suggest that the institutionalized child sexual abuse ever ended. People in all these unhealthy cultures go on about their lives as if this rampant child sexual abuse isn't still happening all around them.

Other kinds of predation are common, with different kinds more or less common in different unhealthy cultures. 

Even soldiers are not safe from predatory behavior. Decades after scientists had established the harmful effects of nuclear radiation, the Soviet Union, United States, France, and Great Britain all knowingly exposed their soldiers to radiation without their consent. Reports from all these countries show that soldiers were expected to remain silent, even as they were left to face terrible injuries, and even as their children were born with deformities that were clearly traceable to radiation poisoning. Soldiers widely understood the risks as well. One French soldier said, "we knew these things," but authorities demanded that soldiers "obey and shut up."

A staggering level of abusive and exploitative behavior always occurs when people allow themselves to be ruled and choose not to stand for what's right. All these disturbing troubles will continue till people can generate healthy cultures again, where everyone stands for what's right, and nobody rules over anybody else.

### Healthy Cultures Don't Have Child Sexual Abuse

Can you imagine a world without child sexual abuse? Not just a world with more women's self-defense classes (which I support), or stronger laws, or better ways of supporting victims. Can you imagine a world without _any_ child sexual abuse?

This world is possible. Healthy cultures do not have child sexual abuse. When the Nootka first encountered Spanish conquistadors, they did not encounter any women. Instead, the Spanish "only brought men and young boys who got used as women whether they liked it or not." Even in their first interaction with Europeans centuries ago, the Nootka noticed regular child rape that remains so common in unhealthy cultures to this day. After a period of uneasy interactions, the Spaniards kidnapped, raped, and murdered two Nootka girls of about 10 years old.

The Nootkas' response showed me that they had never experienced child sexual assault until encountering an unhealthy culture:

> "...The people had no way of understandin' what had happened. There'd never been anythin' like this in all the time since the beginning of life, and so they could only stare at the proof of horror and feel numb shock. They could see what had been done, but they couldn't understand how, or why. It had been hard enough to believe the Keestadores [conquistadors] would force a grown woman to have sex when they didn't want, but the thought of sex with a child was just too horrible for the people to even imagine, so they didn't know what to think.

> The old woman examined both the babies, and it was as if the sure evidence of what she found shook the centrepost of all creation, and threatened the here and now as well as the past and future..."

The Nootka lived without child sexual assault until they encountered an unhealthy culture. This story was transformative for me. This taught me that it is possible to have zero child sexual assault when people can maintain a healthy culture.

I knew child rape was bad, but why was it so bad that it would "[shake] the centrepost of all creation" and "[threaten] the here and now as well as the past and future?"

Healthy cultures see any disrespect as a cultural wound that affects everybody, and I believe that the Nootka recognized that this child rape was a severe disrespect and therefore a severe cultural wound. If this disrespect wasn't fully addressed, everything was at risk, and nothing would be safe.

The Nootka soon allied with neighboring groups and successfully killed all of these conquistadors. They saw how important it was to their culture's survival to protect themselves from predators.

This taught me the importance of maintaining that internal baseline of mutual respect. Once a culture allows disrespect and tolerates selfish predators, there is no end to the trouble.

### Non-Predatory Leadership is Unstable in Unhealthy Cultures

Of course, not all authority figures engage in predatory behavior or serve the rich. Some leaders, such as Jacobo √Årbenz in Guatemala or Salvador Allende in Chile implemented policies that benefited the poor at the expense of the rich. And both were killed in coups by high-ranking military and business officials.

Why is it so hard in unhealthy cultures to elect leaders who actually serve all the people, including the poor? And why are they so quickly killed, corrupted, or replaced when they do get to power?

In healthy cultures, when everyone stands for what's right and generosity is the norm, the people wouldn't tolerate a selfish leader, and selfish leaders are quickly replaced.

When people become obedient and do not stand for what's right in unhealthy cultures, the economy rewards selfishness so that there are a few rich and many poor. In unhealthy cultures, the rich never tolerate generous leaders who might threaten their wealth and privilege, and so the rich overthrow generous leaders.

This shows that _healthy and unhealthy cultures are both stable_, meaning they can maintain their way of life indefinitely. Each type of society will choose leaders that maintain their way of life. Only by creating a healthy culture where everyone stands for what's right can a nation have servant-leaders who actually serve the people.

### When People Learn to "Hold Back" or "Shut Down" Parts of Themselves

[xxx-note: this section mixes two things, adulthood training and early childhood abuse/deprivation. Could be more clear, or could be split into two sections]

Dorothy Parker once described, "The only dependable law of life -- everything is always worse than you thought it was going to be." I agree, except this isn't a law of life -- it's a law of unhealthy cultures. 

Selfishness and corruption are the same thing. So of course, in societies that systematically reward selfishness, there will be pervasive corruption, and no matter how much anybody investigates, there will always be more corruption to find. Unhealthy cultures are rotten to the core, because all of them involve a few rulers exploiting many others and training them to tolerate it.

Julian Assange described how people learn to tolerate exploitation: "Every time we witness an injustice and do not act, we train our character to be passive in its presence and thereby eventually lose all ability to defend ourselves and those we love."

Widespread child sexual abuse, hatred, racism, sexism, pollution, greed, disconnection from nature, and corruption persist endlessly -- and it doesn't matter who we vote for; these things keep happening. It doesn't matter what political party is in power, or whether a society is democratic or theocratic, or capitalist or communist. So long as people are trained to obey the law instead of standing for what's right, these terrible troubles will continue.

Every single human has a deep urge to stand for what's right in their society, and this is the natural urge to uphold the laws they live by. In every society without rulers, children are raised into adults who stand for what's right as a normal, daily way of life.

In unhealthy cultures, children often experience a wide range of traumas where they learn to "hold back" or "shut down" parts of themselves, or ignore some uncomfortable part of reality -- and then learn to ignore that they're holding back. This is simply a normal way to cope with overwhelming situations that can't be dealt with satisfactorily. Essentially, children can learn how to subconsciously tolerate dissatisfaction or disrespect or ignore some aspects of reality so that in adulthood this seems normal.

Some sorts of child abuse are more common than others, but in cultures where rulers force people to tolerate endless predation and not stand for what's right, abuse is inevitable, and in one way or another, nearly everyone learns to hold back somehow. Thus it is common for people to grow up with all manner of emotional troubles, as each abused generation raises the next and passes on different kinds of emotional wounds.

How are people trained to tolerate living in an unhealthy culture with endless predation and abuse? And what qualities would they need to cultivate to have the strength to live in a healthy culture instead?

* _Sensitivity to abuse_: Instead of noticing abuse or exploitation and taking a stand to stop it, people are trained to ignore abuse, make excuses for it, or blame low-privilege people for problems instead of the ruling class.

* _Integrity_: Every human has an urge to stand for what's right in solidarity with others, but this isn't allowed in unhealthy cultures where people are expected to obey the law but not uphold it. When people learn to ignore injustice or feel helpless to stop it, life can seem meaningless, and low integrity becomes common.

* _Bravery_: When the police punish anyone who tries to take a stand against abusive authorities, they arrest the bravest people, scaring the rest into holding back and tolerating abusive behavior. When people are scared into submission, and internally stop seeking ways to stand for what's right, they then prioritize their comfort and safety. Scaring people into submission trains them for cowardice.

* _Generosity_: Profit economies reward selfish, profit-seeking behavior rather than generosity.

* _Humility_: Unhealthy cultures often praise the rich and shame the poor, and train people to think that obedience makes people morally good, and disobedience morally bad. Humility may be mistaken for meekness or submissiveness, instead of the proper attitude of a strong public servant.   

* _Gratitude_: When people live in financial desperation, learn to fear or resent their neighbors, learn to tolerate injustice, and do not know how to receive the gifts of the Earth, it is easy to not feel deep gratitude for the gifts of life.

* _Pleasure_: Many people who are deprived of abundant loving touch in childhood may feel displeasure or dissatisfaction as a normal, baseline experience of life.

* _Nature Connection_: Profit economies force people to seek money or please a boss to survive, rather than build a mutually enriching relationship with the Earth.

* _Remembering_: Everybody has ancestors who lived in healthy cultures in the past, but most have forgotten and think their unhealthy culture is "just how life is."

* _Dignity_: Authoritarian religions train people to feel shame, disconnection from the divinity of life around and within us, belief in inherent badness or selfishness, displeasure, low self-worth, and other negative qualities rather than dignity, pleasure, high self-worth, and deep connection with people and nonhumans.

* _Deep awareness_: Unhealthy cultures often propagate hurtful racist or sexist assumptions, or rigid ideologies and dogmas about how life "should be," whether in economics, religion, politics, education, or anywhere else -- instead of training people for deep awareness.

* _Strong Children_: It is traumatic to live in a society which requires people to obey rulers' laws, and forbids people from standing for what's right even while political, corporate, and religious authorities are obviously exploiting the rest and breaking the law. Adults c

    Even well-meaning parents with emotional troubles can unintentionally act hurtfully towards their children who can develop emotional troubles of their own, meaning emotional troubles are widespread in unhealthy cultures. This emotional wounding is often reinforced in schools and churches that train children to be obedient, and to feel ashamed or bad if they disobey authorities. Training children for obedience is the opposite of training children to bravely stand for what's right.

* _Trust_: Since low-integrity and selfishness are so widespread in unhealthy cultures, many people can easily learn not to trust their neighbors, or be very guarded.

For hundreds of thousands of years, every child was trained for these beautiful qualities, in part so they would have the strength to stand for what's right in solidarity with others in their healthy culture. Only in recent times have unhealthy cultures trained people for hurtful qualities instead so that they will tolerate exploitative authorities and endless abuse.

It is time to end the endless predation. This will require creating new healthy cultures. You and the people around you can do this. What perspectives could help you succeed? Let us explore in _Chapter 12 - Sacred Responsibilities_.
