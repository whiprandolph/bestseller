## Chapter 17: The Deepest Revolution



* Until now, I have only included revolutionary activities that I have embraced in my life. But I have never worked with others to found a nation, so I do not know how everything that is required. But I know the work needs to be done even if I don't know all the steps. 

* Study healthy cultures, become friends with people who carry their healthy-culture traditions. Healthy cultures have found a huge variety of ways of sharing food, choosing servant-leaders, having sexual relationships, eating nutritious diets, raising strong children, living in harmony with the Earth, addressing inappropriate behavior, responding to threats, and more. Consider which ways could work for you, and which wouldn't, and what lessons to learn.

The "Bibliography" section in this book offers a key list of writings on which this book is based, and _one Disease One Cure_ offers many more.

### Find People To Whom You Can Speak Your Heart

* ref mom's story - I know someone who, in the early 1990s, thought about whether it was ok for the US to invade Iraq. She wondered, is the US invading to bring democracy? Or take oil? Is it ok to kill people to take oil?

Unfortunately, she was the wife of a US military officer living on an overseas base, surrounded by soldiers and their spouses. She was unable to find other people to share her concerns with, and speak her heart. She was surrounded by people, but unable to discuss what mattered to her and consider how to respond with others.

Over time, she became more stressed, and she and her husband began speaking of divorce. She had the career and family of her dreams but was deeply unhappy. Finally, she decided to take anti-depressants, which allowed her to numb the feeling of dissatisfaction without responding to it. She stopped thinking deeply about politics.

Plenty of people who feel trapped and unable to respond to their fears cope by numbing their feelings with endless distractions, whether through screen addiction, drugs, overworking, or other ways. These are simply ways people learn to "hold back" or "shut down" parts of themselves to avoid feeling their own dissatisfaction when they don't see a way to respond productively.

The most important step to addressing any concerns or fears you have is this: find other people you trust to tell them how you feel and your concerns and thoughts, and listen to them too. If you don't trust anyone in your life this much, then make new friends.

* This showed me the importance of finding someone you can speak your heart to. Either deepen the friendships you have, or make new friends.

* find people. Start with 1 if you need to, then find another after that.


### Hold Each Other to a High Standard

* You can't control what others do, but you can control yourself. And you can have high expectations for others.

* People noticed big shift after being conquered/forced into unhealthy cultures (Pretty Shield, Rain-in-the-Face quotes, reference health issues from Price, or notice how shocked people like me or liedloff were at relaxed joyfulness)

* 




### Accept Deep Responsibility -- Don't Fear It

* Life and death decisions

### Dream Big and Take Risks

### Become Comfortable with Uncertainty


### Create a Healthy Subculture

Already explored some practices:

* generous sharing

* celebrate good deeds

* practice noticing the gifts you receive, and practice feeling grateful

* etc..

Of course, generosity and selfishness don't mix well. Either help the people in your group feel comfortable sharing and taking care of each other, or evict them till they're ready to share.

What practices could help you cultivate a deep awareness? And 

### Create a New Healthy Culture -- That is, Create a New Nation

### How Much Do You Want Freedom?

Imagine living with such abundance that parents could commonly give their child+spouse a fully outfitted home when they married...




### Nothing Will Save Us From Ourselves
* No economic system, no governance system

### The Deepest Revolution

I have my blindspots, and I continue to learn every day. But there are a few things I know beyond any doubt.

Some people say the arc of history bends towards justice. I say the arc of history bends whichever way people bend it.

Ultimately, we remain in an abusive culture because we tolerate it. Yes, there has been a massive amount of shame, violence, broken promises, lies, and spiritual wounding that make deep change really hard. Rulers and their servants use so many tricks and traps to get us to continue to tolerate our own abuse, to accept our own humiliating submissiveness as legitimate and "just the way life is."

I believe the only way to end abuse is to stop tolerating it. That's what deep revolution is: when enough people take a stand together and take care of each other even at great personal risk in order to create a new way of life. The arc of history bends when enough people choose to give their divine love fully, right now, rather than holding back in hopes of avoiding abuse for another day.

The night before his assassination, Martin Luther King Jr said, "I've seen the promised land. I may not get there with you. But I want you to know tonight, that we, as a people, will get to the promised land."[xxx-mlk final speech afscmd]

I'm telling you I've BEEN to the promised land. I've lived with a whole healthy culture where people routinely have integrity, generosity, respect for men, women and children, deep connection with the Earth, strong leaders, and no rulers.

The promised land is real, and I'll tell you what else I learned -- _**WE are the promised land**_. Every single person can be one of our messiahs, one of our liberators as we free ourselves from the biggest trap in human history. And the more messiahs, the more liberators, the better. _Living with rulers is a catastrophe. Now is the time to end it._

As Jesus Christ, Harriet Tubman, and other spiritual leaders around the world have proven, this is no easy path. Never has been. But now is the time. People are suffering as prison slaves. Pollution is causing all manner of diseases and destruction. Racism and sexism persist. Genocides and hate continue, as do the wars that kill the poor and profit the rich. Nonhumans are dying in large numbers. And nuclear apocalypse threatens all of us.

Kings and billionaires of unhealthy cultures threaten, bribe, trick, and trap countless people to support all these terrible things and more. I believe the only solution is to create new healthy cultures -- new nations, where everybody bravely stands for what's right as a normal way of life.

I don't know how to achieve the transformation I want, but I know where I stand. I stand with the Earth, and I stand for a culture of mutual respect. And I'm not the only one.

Millions of people are standing for the Earth and standing for cultures of mutual respect right now. Some of us were born into healthy cultures, and some of us were born into unhealthy cultures. In countless different ways, all around the world, we are taking this stand together.

And I'd love for you to join us.
