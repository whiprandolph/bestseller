## Chapter 17: The Deepest Revolution, Part 3: We Are the Promised Land

### Give Your Sacred Gifts

* As you recognize your sacred gifts and build your spiritual strength, you'll start feeling an urge to give those gifts. Will you find a way to raise & educate children in respectful ways -- unconditional love while holding them to a high standard? Or protect the Earth where you live? Study healthy cultures so you have more models for good ways to live? Or host training camps to prepare for the Deepest Revolution?

### We Only Have One Political Problem, and There's Only One Solution

* Racism, sexism, greed, privilege, corruption, pollution, poverty in the midst of abundance -- all these troubles exist in any society where people can't choose their own laws, nor uphold them.

* But all the different political problems boil down to one: we're not free. We're punished for doing the right thing and standing for what's right. As long as we ignore that root cultural disease, all these other cultural symptoms will continue endlessly. So the solution to all these troubles is to have the Deepest Revolution and create new healthy nations where people agree on their laws and expect everybody to uphold them, taking the people's and Earth's needs into account.

* Not just one in the US, or one in France or any other country - but probably many, depending on how people are able to form the necessary relationships
