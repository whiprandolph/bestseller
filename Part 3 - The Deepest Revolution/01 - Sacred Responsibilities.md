The sun was setting one evening in 2015 as I sat with about 8-10 of my Ashaninkan hosts. Some of them had gone fishing in the nearby river earlier that day, and we were all passing around pieces of fish they'd caught. I had brought food with me when I first arrived a week earlier, but we had traveled away from my sleeping area, and I didn't have my food with me to share.

But it didn't matter -- they just shared their food like they did every night. I didn't have to give them any money or food, nor even promise to feed them later. They just shared, with a relaxed joyfulness that made eating together a simple pleasure every time.

Ever since they first welcomed me, I had felt this growing sense of gratitude because they had been so generous, and hadn't made any demands in return. They taught me how to spin cotton into yarn, invited me to sing and dance and consume ayahuasca with them, had shared their food and sleeping spaces with me. When I crossed a fast-flowing river up to my waist after a long hike, one man offered to take my pack across. There'd been so many moments where I felt grateful, but that night I felt it specially strongly, and I noticed an equally strong desire to give back to them somehow.

My friend Mike had invited me to join him in this visit to the Ashaninka, and he had told me about their generosity. Before we left the Peruvian town, he had said, "_Bring them gifts. They are such kind and generous people that no matter how many gifts you bring them, you will wish you had brought more._"

Mike was right. I felt so grateful, and I felt an equally strong desire to give back to them. A little later, when I finally shared my big sack of gifts, they seemed pleased with everything, but I still felt a twinge of sadness when the bag was empty, and I didn't have any more material goods left to give. I wished I had more gifts to share.

In later years, I realized that this deep desire to give back to them was an example of reciprocity, a core spiritual practice of healthy cultures. I didn't give them goods in trade, or out of a sense of obligation or need to prove myself. I did it because I noticed the gifts they gave me, and I felt grateful and wanted to give back to the people who gave me so much. (Their generosity and warmth affected me so deeply that I'm tearing up as I write this, almost 10 years later!)

In the following years, I made a big shift -- I started noticing nonhumans giving me gifts too. I noticed the chestnut trees giving gifts of chestnut, without demanding any pay or trade in return. I noticed the nearby stream giving me water for drinking and bathing, and birds who helped me learn to listen carefully. I received gifts of meat, bone broth, and hides from deer, and fire from cedar and basswood trees.

The more I noticed all the gifts I received, the more I wanted to give back -- to the birds and chestnut trees, to the streams and the deer. Just like I was grateful to the Ashaninka, and felt this desire to give back to the people who'd given so much to me, I felt the same desire to give back to the nonhumans who gave so much to me.

In her book _Braiding Sweetgrass_, Potawatomi woman Robin Kimmerer described the importance of this reciprocity: "Each person, human or no, is bound to every other in a reciprocal relationship. Just as all beings have a duty to me, I have a duty to them." If I receive meat from an animal, I am bound to support the animal's family or community. When I eat corn, I have a responsibility to take care of the soil it grows in. When I receive a river's gift of clear water, I am responsible for caring for the river. Kimmerer noted that learning and practicing these responsibilities is "an integral part of a human's education."

I believe living in reciprocity is a sacred responsibility, and really, it's who we are as human beings. No one had to force me to feel gratitude, or force me to give back to the people and nonhumans who gave to me. Indeed, someone would have had to force me _not_ to, the desire to give back was so strong.

These are the three core spiritual practices at play --

1. A practical, aware gratitude: Noticing the gifts of others, both people and nonhumans. 

2. Giving my gifts: giving my deepest love, whether that takes the form of material gifts, mentoring, personal qualities like joy or integrity, or in ways.

3. Living in reciprocity: giving back to the humans and nonhumans who give so much to me.

The big shift was to see myself as the Earth, not somehow different or separated -- another attitude I see in every healthy culture. Okanagan woman Jeannette Armstrong said, "it's not just that we're part of the land... but that the land is us." It's true -- each of us is a gift of the Earth, alive to receive the gifts of others and give our own gifts in reciprocity, each person in their own way.

### Living in Reciprocity as a Normal Way of Life

I never knew how intimately people could know the Earth and even enrich the Earth as a normal way of life till I studied healthy cultures, where people embrace these three core spiritual practices as a normal way of life.

The Apache man Stalking Wolf described how he looked for a tree to make a bow, and he did this in a way that benefitted the whole forest. Guided more by his heart than his mind, he might spend days looking for just the right sapling -- often one in the middle of a thick grove. He verified that removing that particular tree would benefit the grove, and it would also yield a strong bow. After all, the tall straight saplings which had received plenty of sun had had an easy life, and made weak bows. The trees that struggled to survive and reach the sun developed tight growth rings, leading to a bow that could generate much more power. After offering a prayer and receiving permission from Creator, he harvested the bow, knowing the harvest would serve both his people and the forest.

Robin Kimmerer described how Potawatomi people benefit the black ash trees they use to make baskets. Traditional tree harvesters recognize each tree as an individual, nonhuman person. A respectful harvest begins with a request. The tree cutter describes their purpose and asks the tree for permission to be harvested and listens carefully for a response, which is sometimes no. Perhaps something in the surroundings, such as a bird's nest or close neighbor explains why the tree declined to be harvested, or perhaps the person just knows. Either way, the respectful harvester keeps asking trees until they hear a yes. Then they offer a prayer and gift of tobacco before cutting down the tree with great care not to damage its trunk or tree neighbors.

Black ash tree population had been declining in their region in New York State, but when Kimmerer and an assistant investigated, they found that the decline wasn't even across the tree's range -- in some areas the population was increasing, and some areas it was decreasing, and they found that black ashes were actually thriving wherever there were traditional Potawatomi basket makers. Black ash trees need open space in the canopy to thrive; saplings die in full shade. Basket makers opened up the canopy occasionally as they harvested black ash. Where the basket makers no longer harvested, the canopy remained closed and black ash numbers declined.

Humans thus benefited from the black ash, and the black ash benefited from humans. New generations of black ash thrived wherever people respectfully harvested it.

Even hunting relationships can be mutually respectful. A nomadic Mongolian named Bilgee explained to a young Chinese man how his people had respectful relationships with animals they hunted. The wolves sometimes ate the Mongolians' sheep, but they also ate gazelles that eat the same grass as the sheep.
Bilgee said, "Gazelles are a scourge on the grassland... they... eat all the time." He sometimes hunted wolves, but not often, saying, "If we killed them off, the grassland would perish, and then how would we survive?"

Bilgee even said his people don't use wolf pelts as bedding, even though they are far superior to sheep pelts, saying, "We respect the wolves too much... Tengger [God] is the father, the grassland is the mother, and the wolves kill only animals that harm the grassland. How could Tengger not bestow its favors on wolves?"

People living in this way can generate tremendous wild abundance. In their book _A Basic Call to Consciousness_, Mohawk writers described how, when they were able to live in a fully traditional way, taking only what they needed and practicing strict conservation, they lived with "almost unimaginable abundance and variety of nuts, berries, roots, and herbs. In addition to these, the rivers teemed with fish and the forest and its meadows abounded with game..."

This is simply a gift economy in action, where people do not just share generously amongst themselves within their culture, but actively serve the nonhumans around them. The Mohawk writers noted, "ours is a Way of Life, and... our economy cannot be separated from the many aspects of our culture." I believe this is because they do not just share among each other while selfishly taking from the nonhumans. That practice of living in reciprocity doesn't just exist between people, but it's a responsibility towards nonhumans as well.

Stories like these showed me how humans can sustain themselves while serving or enriching the nonhuman life around them. It's not magic, or something only certain people of certain cultures can do. These practices are core to who we are as humans; they're part of each one of us, and they're universal in societies where rulers don't manipulate the lives of everyone else. This is why Cherokee woman Rebecca Adamson said, "tribal people worship the sacredness of creation as a way of life, not as a philosophy or religion."

In unhealthy cultures, a few people force laws on the rest, then punish them for standing for what's right. No wonder it is difficult to live in a good way, where people maintain respect relations within the culture, and between the people and the Earth.

But anyone can practice living in a reciprocal way with the Earth. One simple way is to plant a garden, and tend it in a way that the soil is richer than it would have been if you had planted. I have one organic farmer friend who began farming on bare clay and carefully enriched the soil with careful observation and practices like making biochar, minimal-till, composting his neighbors' poop and urine, bringing in compost from grocery stores in town, and much more. He has added so many more nutrients to the Earth than he's taken through harvest that he's added 13 inches of topsoil -- very different than the field of clay he started with!

Growing up in an unhealthy culture made it hard for me to find these three core spiritual practices. I didn't grow up practicing gratitude as a way of life or receiving the gifts of the Earth, and I didn't grow up practicing deep awareness so that I could see all the gifts I had been receiving without even noticing it. I didn't grow up learning to feel equally grateful for the gifts of nonhumans and humans, and feeling an equally strong desire to give back.

But I have good news: all these perspectives can be practiced. And it turns out, cultivating deep awareness doesn't just help people relate to nonhumans better -- awareness helps people relate to each other better, too.

### Cultivate Deep Awareness and Unity Through Nature Connection Practices

I was pleasantly surprised when I noticed that nature connection practices helped me connect with people in a deeper way than I ever had before. After practicing for years, it's clear to me that if a whole group of people embraced these practices, they could be closely connected indeed.

The _Kamana_ program produced by Jon Young introduces students to a very special nature connection practice called the sit spot. I picked a place outdoors within a few minutes' walk from my home where I could view wildlife. My first sit spot was next to a stream winding through a big forest, but during times when I've moved around a lot, I've also used my backyard or a nearby park.

The goal is to go to the sit spot daily and explore and notice what's going on. What plants grow at what times of the year? What birds live there, and how do they interact with each other and the plants? What animals live there or pass through? I learned to pay attention with all my senses, my eyes, ears, taste, smell, touch, temperature, and more. And I learned to feel curious about the experiences of the beings around me.

I asked myself questions about what I saw. Why would a bird constantly look up as it eats? I learned that they are continuously aware in case predators arrive, so birds constantly eat, look around, eat, and look again. Do some species of tree like growing together and others don't? For example, I learned that black walnuts produce a compound which only some plants find toxic, and thus black walnuts like growing with trees like sugar maple and box elder but avoid trees like white pines.

I continually practiced feeling into the experiences of other beings. For example, I studied hawks and songbirds, and I imagined being a songbird and how terrifying it would be to have a sharp-shinned hawk swoop out of the sky and snatch me in an instant. If I were a songbird, I would probably eat carefully too!

Eventually, I learned that plants and animals could help me notice parts of the landscape I couldn't observe directly. The movement of a bird might indicate a hidden possum moving through low brush. Or, some birds and other animals like deer can see ultraviolet light that is invisible to humans. I might not be able to see rodent poop directly, but birds can see the ultraviolet light reflected off the poop. If I notice birds responding to it, I can learn about the rodents' presence with the birds' help.

The first core spiritual practice -- cultivating a practical, aware gratitude -- is a big part of this sit spot training. I learned that birds and plants and other beings could teach me about my environment, or they could show me when I'm feeling anxious or stressed. They could help me become more aware about my environment or myself if only I became more aware of them. This awareness is a gift that they give. I learned to feel into the birds and plants and streams around me so that they were extensions of me. Their awareness became an extension of my awareness, and the only limit was how carefully I could pay attention, and how well I could interpret the behaviors I observed.

This is training in deep empathy, and I noticed it also helped me with people. For example, growing up, I learned that women can get extra sensitive during their period. For years I found this annoying and learned to leave women alone during this time. But as with my nature connection practices, I started asking, "how is this a gift?" or "what does this have to teach me?" And I noticed that some women friends would reject food during their period that they normally ate, and when I asked, they said the food was rancid. I would try it and I couldn't taste any rancidity at first. Over time, I learned to taste my food more and more, and I began to notice the occasional rancidity, especially in store-bought food. I realized that the sensitive women had noticed something I couldn't notice. Like the birds, women could show me something about my environment that I couldn't notice directly. When a woman said some food was rancid, even if I couldn't detect it, I began to trust her, and I rejected the food too. Over time this helped me notice rancidity I couldn't notice before.

The more I practiced, the more this deep empathy helped me see. For example, when black people complain about police brutality, it shows me where my society isn't as healthy or fair as it seems in my experience. When children complain about being forced to sit through boring classes at school, they show me where adults can behave hurtfully without knowing it. I started treating everyone around me like an extension of me, whether men or women or children or nonhumans. I paid attention to what other people observed or how they behaved and let it show me things I couldn't see by myself. I don't blindly trust everyone, but I take care to notice what lessons I can learn from others.

Noticing all the different ways a person makes the world a better place is one way to receive their gifts. After everyone else went home, which coworker stayed late to get the project done on time? Which activists show up to meetings early so we can start on time? Who maintains a sense of humor in stressful moments, or gives solid constructive feedback instead of lashing out angrily when someone makes a mistake? I just practice noticing and either giving thanks or offering constructive feedback when that seems appropriate.

Receiving nonhumans' gifts is similar. I notice all the ways each tree, stream or deer makes the world a better place. I also notice when they're annoying, like the deer who recently ate my garden, but even that deer had a lesson for me. They taught me where my security was lacking.

I've had women tell me "you're not a woman, so you can't know what it's like." In a sense, that's true. I'm a man, so I can't know what a woman's experience is like. But by the same logic, I cannot know other men's experiences either. I'm not a black man, so I can't know what a black man's experience is like. I'm neither rich nor impoverished, so I can't know what the rich or poor men's experiences are like. I wasn't born into a healthy culture, so I can't know what that experience is like. And I can't know the experiences of birds or trees.

Ultimately, I can only know my own experience, but this doesn't have to limit me when I practice deep empathy. With enough practice asking questions and paying attention, I can see others' perspectives even if their experiences are really different than mine. I might not always agree with someone else's perspectives, but I can at least understand them and understand their behavior. And when I get it wrong, that just becomes another chance to grow my observation skills and learn.

I believe these nature connection practices are a key part of generating unity in a culture. Once I started really noticing the perspectives of insects and bears and plants, I found it easier to understand people's perspectives. I believe when everybody is raised with these nature connection practices, mutual understanding can be common, and this helps healthy cultures find and maintain a deep unity. They also help me make fewer foolish assumptions. Assumptions are simply unexamined beliefs. When I continuously pay attention to what I observe, I notice what I know and what I don't know. There's little room for unexamined beliefs.

### Sacred Responsibilities

For millennia, unhealthy cultures have been spreading, and they encourage and reward people for taking without giving back -- whether by keeping people financially dependent and desperate for money, punishing people for standing for what's right, instilling deep childhood shame, or a thousand other ways.

But the truth remains: living in reciprocity with other people and the Earth is a sacred responsibility. Other sacred responsibilities enable that reciprocity: Cultivating deep awareness and gratitude for the gifts of life, each person cultivating their own sacred gifts and learning how to give their deepest love, learning the practical skills to meaningfully serve other people and the Earth, and more. I believe that embracing these responsibilities is essential for any group that wanted to create a new healthy culture.

There is another sacred responsibility: cultivating the personal strength to stand for what's right, without any compensation, even at great personal risk. To explore how to cultivate this strength, join me in the next chapter: _Integrity and Bravery_.
