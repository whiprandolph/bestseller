## Hold Yourself and Others to a High Standard

* the depth of love and courage that would make you an excellent spiritual leader in the Deepest Revolution is the same depth of love and courage that would get you killed in your unhealthy culture.

* but now you know the risk! You can still give your deepest love, knowing what's even worth dying for like Christ and MLK, but going in eyes wide open instead of having the rug pulled out from underneath you when the police and judges disregard the law to to persecute you.
