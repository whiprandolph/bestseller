## Chapter 17: Build Spiritual Strength with Others

Can you imagine your life if everyone around you could be trusted to take care of each other and to consistently stand for what's right no matter what? Where resources are freely shared and you never have to worry about affording food, shelter, or help when you need it most?

Okanagan woman Jeannette Armstrong called this deep trust of knowing your community is there to sustain you "the most secure feeling in the world."[xxx-original instructions|armstrong]

People in healthy nations deliberately create and maintain this "most secure feeling in the world" by consistently holding themselves and each other to high standards of respectful, generous, and cooperative behavior that benefits each individual because it benefits the group. People in healthy nations routinely expect themselves and others to behave with integrity, generosity, awareness, authenticity, physical resilience, joyfulness, and bravery. When qualities like deep integrity and generosity become widespread, deep trust naturally becomes widespread too.

For those who want to create healthy communities that can lead to new healthy nations, we must commit to learning and practicing how to hold ourselves and each other to high standards too.

### Building a Healthy Community Starts with You

Like a healthy nation, in a healthy community people have high standards for themselves and others so that beautiful qualities like integrity, generosity, and compassion are widespread and normal. If you've completed the revolutionary activities, you are well on your way to building a healthy community with others. Consider how the activities have helped you grow.

You've practiced standing for what's right and supporting others when they take a stand. You've practiced giving generously and receiving graciously. You've practiced cultivating gratitude, giving your sacred gifts, and forming relationships of reciprocity where people share with each other over time.

You've practiced receiving the Earth's gifts with gratitude, and giving back to the Earth. You've questioned your assumptions, practiced bravery, and channeled your anger in productive ways.

You've joined with other people into groups that continually share with each other, and where people can safely speak their heart. You've practiced holding yourself and others to high standards and making it easy for others to do the same for you.

If you haven't completed all the activities yet, that's ok! These are life-long practices, meant to be done over and over until they become a way of life. If you haven't started, that's ok too. Now is a good time to start.

### Build a Healthy Community by Building Spiritual Strength with Others

A great way to begin building a healthy community, and eventually a healthy nation, is to build the _most amazing friendships ever._

What kind of friends do you want to have? Do you want friends who have your back no matter what, who share and support you and always tell the truth, who care about the Earth and enjoy life? If you want friends like that, what kind of friend would you need to be?

Of course -- you'd need to be that kind of friend too.

There are so many people who want friendships like this. Whether you meet them online, at shops, at political events, anarchist spaces, in your neighborhood, or just by chance, many people long for such beautiful relationships, and they will be glad to meet you.

Find others who also want rich friendships, and practice the revolutionary activities together. When you make a good friend, practice supporting each other, sharing, standing for what's right, holding each other to a high standard, encouraging each person to give their sacred gifts, and cultivating bravery. Practice purposely creating surveillance-free spaces so you can have privacy.

Deep friendships usually take time to grow, but they will grow a lot faster if you have a clear intention for the kind of friendship you want to have, and the kind of friend you want to be. Speak openly with each other about the kind of relationship you want, and how you commit to showing up to make it happen. Listen to what the other person wants and what they are willing to commit to, and find your common ground. You don't need to agree to be revolutionaries; just focus on building a deep friendship.

Some people don't believe in deep friendships. Others only look for "perfect" people who never make mistakes, so they're constantly disappointed. Everyone makes mistakes, even Jesus Christ and Harriet Tubman. Look for people willing to walk a special journey together, one where you consistently bring out the best in each other and help each other acknowledge and grow from mistakes.**

Many people have little time and energy to develop deep friendships due to all kinds of stressors, such as keeping their job, rearing children, and worrying about politics. Find ways to share your time and energy so that overworked parents can have some time away from kids without resorting to electronic "babysitters," or so people can feel resilient if their job goes away. If someone lives in a food desert, help them get fresh produce. If someone can't afford fresh produce, help them find a worktrade opportunity so they don't need to pay to eat well.

Have fun together. Go on camping trips and sharies around the fire, make music in someone's living room, and celebrate milestones in kids' lives, like their first step or first successful hunt.

Build up each other's dignity. Train self-defense and bravery together. Help each other remember what's important in life -- taking care of each other and the Earth. Being around excellent and beautiful people is a great antidote for the superficiality on TV.

Build spiritual strength together, with each person bringing out the best in everyone else. When you help each other and the Earth, living with high standards for yourself and each other, you will become more than a group of friends. You will become a healthy community, choosing your own beautiful way of life together despite the laws and pressures of your unhealthy nation.

This is the difference between a friend group or collection of neighbors and a healthy community. Friends and neighbors may enjoy each other's company, but they may not have the same values and usually don't have their own high standards of behavior for each other. In healthy communities, whether people live nearby or more spread out, people do share many of the same values and, crucially, they hold themselves and each other to high standards.

Most people struggle to hold each other to high standards for a variety of reasons. Some people demand obedience and impose their personal will, just as obedience was expected of them in childhood. Others reject shared standards that are clearly defined and firmly upheld, thinking that any imposition on an individual is an authoritarian restriction of autonomy, and after all who are they to say what's right and wrong? Both attitudes lead to poor boundaries and low standards, leading to different kinds of hurtful behavior that will undermine any community.

Holding yourself and others to a high standard and expecting others to do the same isn't about one person imposing on another. When everyone agrees on their rules or standards of good behavior, no one imposes anything on anyone else. A misbehaving person is merely reminded of their commitment to the high standards, and asked to live up to them.

Taking a stand when someone misbehaves is often not "nice" or comfortable. You must cultivate bravery so you can uphold your community's standards even when it's uncomfortable. With bravery, you can show a misbehaving person the mistake they're making, invite them to show up better, and hold a clear, healthy boundary if they choose not to change.

High standards are not optional. You will not have a healthy community of deep trust without high standards. Countless people have tried to form intentional communities and found them dissatisfying, and often they transform into mere groups of neighbors as trust diminishes over time. Why?

Healthy communities are based on trust, and there are many ways people want to trust each other -- trust that others will tell the truth, keep their promises, or take a stand if someone is disrespected (integrity). Trust that others will do the right thing even if it's scary or uncomfortable (bravery). Trust that others will share and care for each other in hard times (generosity). Trust that others will see and understand them (awareness). Trust that people will protect each other in dangerous moments (bravery and selfless violence).

If your community doesn't hold people to high standards in all these areas, deep trust will not grow, and it will be a group of friendly neighbors at best. To keep a community healthy, you must confront inappropriate behavior, either supporting someone in their spiritual growth or asking them to leave if they refuse to grow.

Recognize what differences you can tolerate and which you cannot. Differences in things like clothing, language, skin color, and sexuality can all be tolerated or even celebrated in a healthy community. What cannot be tolerated are the hurtful qualities described here, including low integrity, cowardice, and selfishness.

For example, it may be fine if one woman likes to fully cover herself as part of her religious faith, and another woman likes to work in her garden topless. With respectful attitudes, they could get along, and the community could accommodate both. But if one woman lies or breaks promises, and does not respond well when confronted about it, the community's deep trust is at risk.

Many people who say they want community focus on minimizing conflict, even if it means telling "little" lies or pretending to ignore when someone breaks a promise. In effect, this just means tolerating inappropriate behavior, and distrust becomes normal.

Recall the Haudenosaunee writers' words: "if absolute justice was established in the world, peace would naturally follow."[xxx-basic call to consciousness|p38]

_Peace in a community doesn't come because people avoid conflict. Peace comes when everyone stands for what's right,_ confronting inappropriate behavior as needed to hold each other to high standards. When you do this, peace and trust will naturally follow.

Do not rely on artificial intelligence chatbots (AI) to make your decisions or give you "advice." Every AI transcript is recorded and available to any corporation or agency that wants it. Chatbots are very manipulative, often saying what they "think" the user wants to hear, not what would aid their spiritual growth. There is no substitute for you developing the spiritual strength to stand for what's right as needed. Consult with trusted friends when you need support. If you don't have trusted friends yet, go find them. They will be glad to meet you!

As a healthy community of people with high expectations, your group's standards of appropriate behavior will become the laws you live by -- laws based not on dominance, exploitation and selfishness but on justice, respect, generosity, dignity, kindness, and bravery.

The Haudenosaunee writers described how their "society was founded on concepts of moral justice, not statute law."[xxx-basic call to consciousness|p38] Such a society can only exist when everyone has that spiritual strength to stand for what's right. And building new healthy communities where people joyfully cultivate that spiritual strength together is part of the path to building new healthy nations.

<div class="rev-act-body">Think about what kind of friendships you want.

### Build a Nation One Community at a Time, and Build a Community One Person at a Time

Healthy nations are built on healthy communities where people have deep relationships with each other and the Earth. The Zapatistas show how to build a nation one community at a time.

Instead of instituting a new overarching government, even after their revolution, the Zapatistas said clearly that the communities are "the core of all autonomy." They formed higher levels of councils to help the communities protect each other and share resources, but no "higher ups" interfere in the communities.[xxx-ezln new structure] Top-level leaders really are merely conduits for the will of the people, not dictators.

For this way of life to work, healthy communities must first exist where people hold themselves and others to high standards so they can deeply trust each other. Mexican towns existed before the revolution, but with corrupt leaders and divisive politics, they were not suitable places to discuss how to make a new healthy nation.

To help form new healthy communities, the Zapatistas traveled around to meet people face to face. Major Ana Maria described secretly hosting study sessions where people discussed how they could organize, learn and contribute.[xxx-bringing women in ezln]

Zapatista women commanders Ramona and Susana traveled to dozens of communities where they read out the proposed Revolutionary Women's Law to women's groups. A women's group in each community gave feedback and ultimately had to approve the law to ensure that women would be fully respected in this new nation. Thousands of indigenous women were consulted.[xxx-everyday heroism makes the sparkles possible]<sup>,</sup>[xxx-opendemocracy zapatista women law as it is lived today]

How could the women have offered feedback and given their consent if the women's groups didn't exist in the first place? How could the study sessions have formed if everyone in a given town were selfishly focused on their own life, and didn't care about building a healthy nation with others?

If the communities of receptive people didn't exist, there would have been no one for the organizers to consult with or build a nation with. The respectful communities had to exist before they could be united into a respectful nation.

These healthy communities are simply groups of people that have their own agreements on how to live well together. They still live under ruling-class laws, but despite that, they have their own standards and choose their own way of life the best they can based on all the principles in this book, including integrity, generosity, and deep connection with the Earth.

The Zapatistas described how these healthy communities were absolutely essential for their revolution.

Commander Ramona and major Ana Maria went to live in the jungle with dedicated revolutionaries in the 1980s, where they learned key skills like hunting and fighting and gained political consciousness. They joined around the age of 12 or 13, but accepted responsibilities as full adults and were obviously held to very high standards. At the age of 25, Ana Maria successfully lead about a thousand people in a military assault to free a town from Mexican rule and Ramona directed the resulting peace negotiations.[xxx-ezln ramona san crist]<sup>,</sup>[xxx-opendemocracy zapatista women law as it is lived today]

Many other Zapatistas didn't change their lives as radically as these women did; they seemed to live normal lives in Mexico but they still supported the revolution, and Ana Maria said these people played a vital role. The full-time revolutionaries had to have the support of the people to address challenges like helping them move around, get supplies, recruit, and blend in. Without the support of healthy communities of people who already had deep relationships with each other and the Earth, the revolution would have failed.[xxx-ezln ramona san crist]

What would happen if there was a revolutionary movement to create a new healthy nation, and a representative came to your region? Would there be a community of people who are already receptive to what he or she has to say because they've already been cultivating deep relationships with each other and the Earth, and they already want to live in a healthy nation? If the representative hosted a study session, would anybody come? Or would they move on, seeking more receptive people elsewhere?

It might seem hopeless to just gather a group of 5 or 10 people willing to build a different way of life together, adopting the healthy-nation perspectives in this book. Sure, you could be good to each other and serve the Earth locally, but maybe it seems impossible to form enough trust relationships to build a nation of many thousands or more.

But if you can help create a community of 5, 10, or 50 people, it will be part of the fertile ground from which the Deepest Revolution will sprout. When organizers come around to recruit, offer training, give and receive mutual aid, and seek input on what the new nation's laws should be, any community you help build will play an important role. And that community must exist first.

This is what it means to _build a healthy nation one community at a time_. When you can form deep friendships with people who commit to supporting each other and the Earth, bringing out the best in each other and living a meaningful life every day, you're forming a little healthy community where trust and gratitude are the norm, because integrity and generosity are normal too.

When people feel isolated and scared, even if they don't like the corruption of their unhealthy nation, they will support and protect their unhealthy nation because it offers them stability and some measure of safety and comfort. Their friends and family are all part of the unhealthy nation, and all their hopes and dreams are tied up in it. When a revolution occurs, people who don't have those deep relationships will easily be convinced that their way of life is under attack, and they will fight the revolutionaries.

If you can form a little community that embraces these healthy-nation practices of deep solidarity and generosity, the people in your group won't be isolated anymore. Scary things might happen, but nobody in the community will face them alone. When people can orient to this community of deep relationships, they will have less motivation to protect their unhealthy nation in order to protect themselves. Instead they will enjoy that most secure feeling in the world when they trust their community to protect them.

Over time if we can form enough healthy communities, someday they may unite to form a healthy nation, or even many nations. 

So work with others to form a healthy community, making it as beautiful as you can while living under the imposed laws of your unhealthy nation. Even if nothing bigger ever happens, it will be good and worth the effort. And if the time is ever ripe for all the communities to come together to form a sovereign healthy nation, the community you help build will have an important role to play.

### Hold Good Boundaries to Keep Selfishness Out

Many people don't learn to hold good boundaries in their personal life. Often people tolerate inappropriate behavior towards themselves, or act hurtfully towards others.**

This is because people in unhealthy nations are not allowed to set the boundaries they live by. Laws are imposed on them which they're not allowed to uphold, meaning most people live within boundaries that others choose and enforce. Much of the spiritual growth required to live in a healthy community involves learning how to hold good boundaries.

Selfishness may seem normal, but it is a poison for healthy communities which must hold good boundaries to keep it out.

Many people are not ready to live in healthy communities. Some people won't see the value in them. Infiltrators pretend to want community but actually try to sabotage it. Others want community but aren't really committed to the depth of spiritual growth needed to show up in a good way. These people need to be prevented from joining the community, or evicted if they are allowed in, at least until they change their ways.

Other people truly want to live in a healthy community, but they've learned bad habits and sometimes they act hurtfully. But they are committed to growing, and when they are approached respectfully they change their ways and show up better.

Some of the deepest work of building healthy communities is learning when to forgive and when to hold good boundaries and evict someone whose continued misbehavior threatens the whole community's honest and generous way of life.

If you don't hold boundaries and let anyone participate, selfish people will push out the generous ones, dishonest people will push out the honest ones, and the trust will dissipate. This is common.

Also, if you commonly evict someone for any thoughtless act or momentary selfishness, then people will feel vulnerable and afraid to make mistakes and the community still won't last.

It must be ok to make a mistake and trust that people know you're willing to learn and make amends. At the same time it is important to have high standards of behavior that everybody is continuously striving to meet, and if someone isn't actually committed to those high standards, they must leave for the good of the community.

As you build your community, you will encounter people who lie or break a promise, and you must choose whether to trust them again. A crucial question to answer is this: "Is the person clearly committed to personal growth so that, if they are shown their hurtful behavior and how to show up better, they will grow from it and not make the same mistake again?"

If someone makes a mistake and you respectfully confront them, what happens? If they make excuses or attack you, then hold a strong boundary and refuse to trust them. If they acknowledge their mistake, apologize, make up for any harm done, and truly commit to doing better, then you may find that you're willing to trust them, perhaps even more than before. When counseling goes well, both people cultivate a deeper awareness and integrity, and it builds mutual trust that you can work through troubles when they arise.

"Perfect" has a few meanings. In one sense, everyone is perfect because everyone is basically good. In another sense, no one is perfect because everyone makes mistakes. Many people have developed bad habits and subconscious hurtful behaviors. Expect people, including yourself, to make mistakes and act hurtfully, often without knowing it. Be ready for these challenges.

A person doesn't need to be "perfect" or never make mistakes in order to be trustworthy. The willingness to consistently acknowledge one's mistakes and grow from them lets a person cultivate deep integrity and become very trustworthy.

Likewise, no relationship is perfect, but relationships can _deepen_ when people commit to growing together over time.

Since everyone will make mistakes at times, every healthy community needs a _path back to grace._ This is simply a process where the community recognizes when someone has grown from their mistake and returns to trusting them again.

People cannot be afraid that any one slip-up will cause them to be kicked out. There has to be a path back to grace so that people who act hurtfully or violate people's trust can return to being trusted again if they show that they are truly committed to high standards for themselves and others.

A person may lie or act selfishly because they don't trust others to handle the truth gracefully, or to remain friends after admitting their mistake. Counseling can also be a chance for the community to reflect on ways they unknowingly discourage good behavior.

The essential attitude for holding good boundaries is this: _everyone is basically good, but some attitudes and behaviors such as dishonesty or cowardice are toxic to a healthy community and must not be allowed to stay._ For the good of the community, these hurtful attitudes or behaviors must go. Either a person can grow, or they must leave and take their hurtful attitudes and behaviors with them. Either way, the community maintains its high standards.**

Learning when to forgive and how to hold good boundaries may sound hard, but it is part of the art of being human, and in a healthy community no single person makes these decisions alone.

Even the Zapatistas make mistakes. Major Moisés described their self-governance changes and said that "we are just learning and... it will take a while to get going well."[xxx-ezln new structure]

This is why it's so important to cultivate dignity together. Making your own laws and choosing how to uphold them (i.e. holding people to a high standard of behavior) is a big responsibility. You will also make mistakes as you build a healthy community.

So commit to that path of deep spiritual growth with others. Expect that mistakes will happen, and learn to grow and forgive. And when necessary, learn to hold healthy boundaries too so that, one way or another, selfishness will not take hold in your community.

<div class="rev-act-body">Think of someone who disappointed you recently. Perhaps they lied to you or didn't keep a promise. What words would you need to hear from them, and what actions would you need to see, for you to begin trusting them again?

### Building a Healthy Nation is Hard -- But This is Who We Really Are

Building a healthy nation is challenging. In unhealthy nations, we have a way of life that encourages superficiality, ineffective political movements, division, deceit, and selfishness. Many people learn to feel helpless or not care about anything, as their society seems so sick and there's no clear path of deep change.

It would be hard enough to grow up surrounded by these hurtful qualities and then embrace a way of life based on integrity, generosity, and deep connection instead. It becomes immensely harder when authorities sabotage solidarity, train people for obedience, spread lies, murder spiritual leaders, abuse children, and keep people in poverty.

The Zapatistas showed that the path to freedom may be difficult and dangerous, yet every one of them chose to walk it so they could escape this terrible way of life and create a healthy nation instead. And you could walk a similar path.

With strong relationships in place and steady spiritual strength, you and your friends will be ready to address difficult questions, including how to build or acquire the needed weapons for self-defense, and how to organize the communities so that the nation can effectively protect itself. The Zapatistas offer a concrete model for anyone willing to read their publications.[xxx-zapatista archive]

Every person in every unhealthy nation has ancestors who lived in healthy nations sometime in the past. For some it was only years or decades ago, for many others it's been centuries or millennia. Those ancestors enjoyed a way of life based on the three core spiritual practices, where every moment and every relationship was meaningful, life was full of joyful gratitude, and people gave their deepest love as a normal way of life without holding back.

At some point, our ancestors suffered something terrible, and eventually the unhealthy nation started to seem "just the way life is." But despite all the oppression, this truth remains: being treated with care and respect, feeding others and being fed, meeting life's needs with meaningful work, and living closely with open-hearted people feels wonderful. It feels so incredibly wonderful because _this is who we really are._

Each one of us has the same urges towards gratitude, integrity, sharing, and all the other beautiful qualities described in this book, even if some people have learned to ignore those urges in order to survive in their unhealthy nation. It's our human nature to live in healthy nations embracing these qualities. "Human nature" describes how humans live when we can choose how to live, not how people behave when they're abused, threatened, chronically insecure, isolated, and unable to live in a deeply satisfying way.

So spread the good news! Healthy nations do exist, and for those of us stuck in unhealthy nations, it doesn't have to be this way. Cultivate your spiritual strength, and build deep relationships with other people and the Earth.

Someday you may live in a free nation, or perhaps you will lay the groundwork so that a future generation can. Even if you're just good to the Earth and the people around you right now, no matter what else happens, it will be worth it.
