For thousands of years, unhealthy cultures have spread around the world. Every unhealthy culture is a dictatorship, where a few people dictate the law and expect obedience from everyone else. Countless people have discussed and sought freedom -- but without knowing what freedom is even like!

In the 1770s, American revolutionaries cried "Give me Liberty or give me Death!" while fighting to preserve a chattel slave society. In the 1910s, rebels worked to create a revolutionary workers' paradise to replace the Russian monarchy, but the resulting Soviet government was so oppressive that people were sent to jail for decades merely for reading the wrong book. 

Christian missionaries have traveled the world ostensibly to share Jesus' wisdom, but their attitudes of body-shaming, women-shaming, sex-shaming, equating pleasure and sin, belief in people's inclination to evil or disconnection from god, and other profoundly hurtful attitudes have actually trained people not to have the personal strength to stand for what's right, as Jesus Christ did. For centuries, anyone who didn't adopt this deeply hurtful Christian interpretation of Jesus Christ's teachings was labeled a heretic and tortured to death. The history of Islam, Buddhism, and other authoritarian religions have similar stories.

As the Haudenosaunee writers noted, "We need to identify the process that so often leads people who are honestly seeking to resist and destroy colonization to unconsciously recreate the elements of their own oppression."

A few thousand years ago, every human alive lived in healthy cultures, meaning every human has ancestors who once lived in a beautiful way. Some people have been trapped in unhealthy cultures for decades, and other people and their ancestors have been trapped for centuries or millennia. Each in their own way, ruling classes around the world consistently train people to tolerate and even support having rulers impose law on them. People are trained not to have a deep connection with nonhumans, and not to notice what's missing. They're trained to think they're free because they can vote, or choose what job they work at. They're trained to think they don't need to stand for what's right because it's the police's job to enforce the law -- which means they're trained for cowardice. They're trained to think "tribes" all transitioned to "civilizations" thousands of years ago, and due to agriculture or population size, no other way of life is possible. They're trained for selfishness, shame, distrust, isolation, despair, and other paralyzing qualities that discourage people from standing for what's right in solidarity with each other and the Earth.

This deep unhealthy-culture training explains why, when a ruling class has suddenly lost power historically, oftentimes people have installed other rulers to lead them instead of taking the opportunity to build a healthy culture. People trained for distrust, cowardice, low integrity, selfishness, and disconnection from nature may not even believe humans could live in a healthy culture -- much less know how to create one.

These qualities of personal strength cannot be understated. When Haudenosaunee writers described their traditional way of life, they wrote, "universal justice is the product of a spiritually strong society, and many of [our] rules... are designed to create a strong society rather than a strong government." When everyone stands for what's right, the government responds to the people. When too few stand for what's right, unhealthy cultures result.

I believe all humans want to be in a culture where they can deeply trust their neighbors. What would it take for people to earn that depth of trust? For there to be deep trust, there also needs to be deep integrity, and the bravery to do what's right even when it's scary or hard. Deep trust requires widespread generosity instead of selfishness. Deep trust requires neighbors who seek the truth by cultivating awareness rather than making hurtful assumptions or clinging to rigid dogmas. Deep trust requires people who accept the sacred responsibilities of living in a good way. I believe the path to building healthy cultures involves deep training in all these healthy-culture qualities.

As Okanagan woman Jeannette Armstrong said, "The realization that people and community are there to sustain you creates the most secure feeling in the world..." Ultimately, I believe this deep trust comes when everyone in a group commits to acting in service of each other, and in service of the Earth.

### Instead of Fighting Symptoms Separately, What if Activists Addressed the Root Disease Together?

There is sexism in every unhealthy culture, and countless feminist movements have worked throughout history to fight sexism, and yet not a single feminist movement has ever ended sexism in their unhealthy culture.

The rich exploit the workers in every unhealthy culture, and countless labor activists have worked to stop exploitation of workers, and yet not a single labor movement has successfully ended the exploitation of workers in their society.

Some feminist groups have improved the treatment of women, just like some labor movements have improved wages or working conditions, at least somewhat. But no group in history has ever fully ended sexism or oppression of workers in their unhealthy culture. The same is true for almost any cause:

* _Child sexual abuse_: Countless people have worked to end child abuse, and no social movement has ever ended child sexual abuse in their unhealthy culture.

* No _environmental movement_ has ever completely ended pollution or environmental destruction within their culture.

* No _anti-poverty movement_ has ever ended poverty in their society.

* No _nature connection movement_ has ever helped everyone in their society live in deep connection with the Earth.

* No _peace activists_ have ever made authorities permanently stop pushing for wars that serve the rich, or caused politicians to stop spreading lies and hate in support of war.

* No _anti-racism activists_ have ever fully ended racism in their unhealthy culture.

Activists may occasionally see some positive changes after years or decades of effort, but what would it take to have big, enduring victories and deep cultural change? The racism, sexism, disconnection from nature, widespread child abuse, environmental destruction, wars that serve the rich, and many other troubles are not actually different problems. They are merely symptoms of the same root cultural disease, where _a few people impose law on everybody else, and forbid people from upholding the laws they live by_.

As any doctor knows, treating a symptom will never actually lead to deep healing because the underlying disease persists. So long as activists treat racism, sexism, greed, child abuse, pollution, and political corruption as different problems, and allow rulers to persist, all these big troubles will tragically persist too and meaningful, enduring change will be elusive.

My dream is for feminists to join forces with people fighting racism, and for them to work with environmentalists, labor activists, and others. What if all these different activists didn't just fight separately against the symptoms, but also addressed the root cultural disease together and created new healthy cultures?

### Talking About Revolution

I recently discussed revolution with a friend, and he said people would probably be killed, and so that wasn't an option. A few days later, I discussed it with another friend, and she said she was really financially stressed, and many people were, so it's not a good time.

The truth is it's always been a hard time for revolution since the earliest unhealthy cultures, and it will always be a hard time. Spiritual leaders like Martin Luther King Jr and Jesus Christ will be assassinated, and others will be imprisoned. The tap water may be turned off, jobs will go away, infiltrators inserted, snitches recruited, bank accounts frozen, and children threatened. None of these are unusual tactics when a group of oppressed people decides to stand up for themselves. The list is endless, including bringing in the military, as the Zapatistas also encountered. 

The trouble is that the abuses are endless too, as they have been for so many centuries. So long as people remain in unhealthy cultures, they cannot protect themselves from endless sexism and racism imposed and encouraged by authorities, child sexual abuse by many authorities themselves, hatred and ignorance, unfair laws and biased law enforcement, political corruption and corporate greed, pollution and environmental destruction, widespread financial desperation, superficial electoral politics, feelings of isolation, depression, helplessness and meaninglessness, and more.

Any culture with unaccountable leaders and a few wealthy people will always have these problems. Cultures where most people prioritize their safety and comfort, and don't take any personal risks to stand for what's right, will always have these problems.

But it doesn't have to be this way.

### The Deepest Revolution

Many people fear that their country is getting "less free" or is "becoming fascist." Unhealthy cultures are all dictatorships, were a few people dictate the law and how it's enforced, and the rest are expected to obey. They do not become more or less free over time.

Instead, people simply learn to accept certain amounts of exploitation and abuse as legitimate and normal. When ruling classes want to increase the normal levels of exploitation or suppress people's speech, this can seem like a loss of freedom. But this is like prisoners complaining that the warden is reducing the amount of time they can spend outside in the courtyard. Yes, life is worse after the change. But the prisoners weren't free before it.

In shallow revolutions, people overthrow their ruling class only to install new rulers. The ideologies might change, but the exploitation remains, and the lives of most people don't change much. 

I believe the deepest revolution occurs when a group takes a stand together, creating their own laws to make a respectful society, and protecting themselves from any unhealthy cultures that might try to reconquer them. This was the Zapatistas' path. They did not march on the capital of Mexico and take over the country, which would have only made them rulers of an unhealthy culture. Instead they took a stand for their own laws and protected each other when the military attacked.

In a sense, the deepest revolution is simple: a group of people would simply need to make agreements with each other, and then have the integrity and bravery to uphold those agreements. They would need to make agreements about how to protect themselves from selfish outsiders. They would need to agree on how to treat each other respectfully, and resolve disputes. They would need to make agreements about how to share, make decisions, and account for the needs of the Earth where they live.

Of course, this begs many questions. What would these agreements look like exactly? How could a group of deep integrity grow, cultivating trust between people who used to be strangers? How could people cultivate deep generosity despite living in a profit economy which rewards selfishness? How could people learn how to receive the Earth's gifts in respectful ways, including fire, shelter, food, water, and life lessons? How could a group survive in the face of infiltrators and snitches? How could such a group effectively defend itself and the land, including with effective weapons?

There are no easy answers, but I think the answer is simple: once they truly commit to deep change, every person and group _will figure it out_. Of course, "simple" doesn't mean "easy." It helped me to find healthy cultures and people of unhealthy cultures who can teach by example. I collected many stories in _One Disease One Cure_ from healthy cultures around the world, showing how people maintain a way of life with widespread integrity, generosity, and dignity, all while living in reciprocity with nonhumans. There are also examples of people of unhealthy cultures acting with incredible bravery and integrity even knowing it might cost them their lives, including Harriet Tubman, Jesus Christ, and Martin Luther King Jr. Find the heroes and mentors who can inspire and teach practical lessons.

No agreements can account for everything either -- people will simply need to be flexible, and willing to keep standing for what's right as times change. The Zapatistas kept making adjustments to their leadership system long after their revolution in 1994, and almost 30 years later a Zapatista leader still said, "we are just learning and... it will take a while to get going well." So long as everyone maintains that attitude of service, that willingness to stand for what's right, they will find a good path.

I believe every human is born knowing what they need to live in a healthy culture. We are healthy cultures; each one of us has the same urges towards gratitude, awareness, integrity, sharing, and all the other beautiful qualities explored in this book, even if many have been trained not to act on these urges. Every one of us has deep love to give, even if some have been trained to hold that love back. Every one of us can embrace and live these qualities at any time, generating healthy subcultures everywhere we go.

I see each individual as a little potential healthy-subculture bubble. As these individuals find each other, they can form healthy subcultures together. The healthy-subculture bubbles can then grow and merge and grow even more, as open-hearted people keep finding each other, helping each other grow into their best selves and creating the kind of subculture they want to have. And when the group is ready to fully take a stand for each other and the Earth, they can take that stand and create a sovereign healthy culture together.

My suggestion is: find a person to have this sort of deep connection with. Then find another. And then go from there.
