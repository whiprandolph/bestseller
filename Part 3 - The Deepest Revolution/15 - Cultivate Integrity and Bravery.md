Countless people have been trapped in unhealthy cultures for centuries or even millennia.

What do you think is the biggest trouble that keeps people trapped, generation after generation?


Sioux man Ohiyesa said, "while Indians unqualifiedly say what they mean, the whites have a hundred ways of saying what they do not mean."



### Dignity and Self-Respect: Give Your Gifts Even in the Face of Hopelessness

* People treat their living spaces like they treat themselves. 


* Practice not only cleaning up after yourself, but cleaning up after other people. When I visit my sit spot each day, there is always new trash, and I always pick up some and put it in the bin. I know it doesn't reduce the amount of trash in the world, but just moves it out of my area. And I know there will be more trash tomorrow, so I know I can't make it permanently clean. But leaving the world more beautiful and more excellent than I found it is who I am -- and it's who you are too.

Even if things seem hopeless, with huge environmental troubles, imperialism, and oppression, you can still move through the world with dignity and self-respect, offering your gifts.

Black Elk showed me how to have this kind of bravery, to give my deepest love even when things look bleak. He and other Lakota expected to die once after being captured by the Americans. They dressed for death and began singing death songs as they wished to end life bravely even if they could not escape. He said, "if it was the end of our lives and we could do nothing, we wanted to die brave. We could not fight this that was going to kill us, but we could die so that our spirit relatives would not be ashamed of us."

Humans may well go extinct soon -- or maybe not. Nuclear war, climate change, and the spread of chemical toxins all can seem overwhelming and inevitable. 


But the truth is that many people have struggled with despair and depression for millennia. William Wallace said, "Every man dies. Not every man truly lives."

### Commit to Personal Growth with Others

* Hold yourself and others to a high standard of excellent behavior. Of course no one's perfect, and many people have plenty of shame, low self-worth, and other qualities to grow out of. So long as people remain committed to being their best selves, acknowledging and learning from each mistake, they will walk a good path.

* having high expectations brings out the best in others -- people often rise or fall to the standards set for them. So if your friends ever tolerate less than your best, remind them you expect better from them.

* practice making promises to yourself and practice keeping them. When you sometimes break those promises, practice not feeling shame, but figuring out what lessons to learn so you can show up better in the future.

* If you do not have such friends, go make new friends. They will be glad to know you. 

* hold each other to high standards -- 

  * high standard of integrity

  * health

  * cooperation

* many people say it is good to be busy. In a culture where people who don't work are either impoverished or wealthy, many try to stay busy to make money to sustain themselves. And yet... cannot hear that divine voice if life is fully of meaningless work and distractions.

### Your Integrity is the Structure of your Culture

* Anyone can make agreements. What brings those agreements to life is upholding them. Having agreements and upholding them is what turns a collection of people into a community or a nation.

* Bravery -- do the right thing no matter what (see opening quotes in sacred masc chapter)

* Cultivate integrity by a simple 5 step process:

1. *Commit:* Hold yourself to a standard of complete integrity: telling the truth, keeping your promises, and acting in service of what matters to you.

2. *Notice:* Notice when you're out of integrity -- when you don't tell the truth, or you're late to a meeting, or you act selfishly somehow.

3. *Release shame:*: Don't feel shame. If you notice yourself feeling shame, let that go. Remind yourself that you're not bad; you just made a mistake and you can grow from it. Releasing any shame is extremely important.

4. *Decide:* Decide what lessons to learn from your mistakes. Why did you not show up with integrity? What could help you show up better next time?

5. *Recommit:* Commit to living fully in integrity again.

### Cultivate Integrity


### Cultivate Bravery

* many think of bravery as fearlessly facing danger, but that's a limiting perspective.

I think of bravery this way: _A person showing bravery remains fully conscious and acts in service of what matters under any challenge._

In other words, a brave person "does what's right" or "does the right thing" no matter what -- even at great personal risk.

### Cultivate Physical Strength and Endurance

* Strength is a skill

* Ohiyesa _Soul of the Indian_: body as a "temple of the spirit" and "supple, symmetrical, graceful, and enduring"

A friend of mine taught me never to make excuses to avoid physical training. He is paralyzed from the waist down and cannot walk, but still practices his pull-ups.

If he can practice pull-ups, so can I. And so can you!

_Convict Conditioning_, _Naked Warrior_ - careful progression, starting where you're at and increasing over time. I could not do a single pull-up when I started. A few years later I did 510 pull-ups in a day.

Just like Wim Hof program for cold training - slow, steady, skillful progression

* Everything is a Skill You Can Practice - personal qualities like awareness and bravery, physical abilities like strength and cold resilience, just like any other skill such as drawing or math. 


#### Direct Your Awareness with Intention

Advertisers try to grab your attention to sell you things. News shows grab your attention to sell you advertising, or to distract you from the real news.

Many people want your attention for selfish reasons. Recognize where you put your attention -- is watching the news help you understand things that are actually important to you, in a way that changes decisions you make in your life? Or does it cause needless worry and stress?

Does learning about another example of corruption change the path you're on? Does learning about one more murder or one more glamorous celebrity help you find wisdom? No, they don't. And now AI chatbots are becoming pretend-friends and pretend-lovers for lonely people, distracting them even more. 

Focus your attention on the most meaningful things -- joyful times with loved ones, protecting the Earth, giving your gifts. 

#### Protect Each Other

* Standing up for one's self and others is the ultimate act of self-respect. The fact that so many people tolerate so much abuse indicates how little self-respect there is in unhealthy cultures. 

Awareness, integrity, bravery -- these are skills that can be practiced.

#### Everything is a skill -- integrity example

* Integrity is a skill, with many sub-skills

* One subskill: how to rebuild trust when someone acted out of integrity, or in an untrustworthy way?

* path back to grace, or _return to integrity_ -- return to a place of mutual trust

* is equivalent to the path of personal growth -- verifying that the person is fully committed to that high standard, and they're on their way

#### Transitions Show that High Standards are Reasonable

Prechtel in _Secrets of the Talking Jaguar_: "thugs, gangs, rape, murder, guns, drug addiction, and overpopulation" all set in within 5 years of being conquered by soldiers and "deculturated" by Christian missionaries.

#### Decide What's Worth Dying For

You're going to die. The question is what's worth dying for, what's worth risking your life for, and what's not?
