## Chapter 15: Cultivate Integrity and Bravery



### Dignity and Self-Respect: Give Your Gifts Even in the Face of Hopelessness

* People treat their living spaces like they treat themselves. 


* Practice not only cleaning up after yourself, but cleaning up after other people. When I visit my sit spot each day, there is always new trash, and I always pick up some and put it in the bin. I know it doesn't reduce the amount of trash in the world, but just moves it out of my area. And I know there will be more trash tomorrow, so I know I can't make it permanently clean. But leaving the world more beautiful and more excellent than I found it is who I am -- and it's who you are too.

Even if things seem hopeless, with huge environmental troubles, imperialism, and oppression, you can still move through the world with dignity and self-respect, offering your gifts.

Black Elk showed me how to have this kind of bravery, to give my deepest love even when things look bleak. He and other Lakota expected to die once after being captured by the Americans. They dressed for death and began singing death songs as they wished to end life bravely even if they could not escape. He said, "if it was the end of our lives and we could do nothing, we wanted to die brave. We could not fight this that was going to kill us, but we could die so that our spirit relatives would not be ashamed of us."

Humans may well go extinct soon -- or maybe not. Nuclear war, climate change, and the spread of chemical toxins all can seem overwhelming and inevitable. 


But the truth is that many people have struggled with despair and depression for millennia. William Wallace said, "Every man dies. Not every man truly lives."

### Commit to Personal Growth with Others

* Hold yourself and others to a high standard of excellent behavior. Of course no one's perfect, and many people have plenty of shame, low self-worth, and other qualities to grow out of. So long as people remain committed to being their best selves, acknowledging and learning from each mistake, they will walk a good path.

* having high expectations brings out the best in others -- people often rise or fall to the standards set for them. So if your friends ever tolerate less than your best, remind them you expect better from them.

* practice making promises to yourself and practice keeping them. When you sometimes break those promises, practice not feeling shame, but figuring out what lessons to learn so you can show up better in the future.

* If you do not have such friends, go make new friends. They will be glad to know you. 

* hold each other to high standards -- 

  * high standard of integrity

  * health

  * cooperation

### Your Integrity is the Structure of your Culture

* Anyone can make agreements. What brings those agreements to life is upholding them. Having agreements and upholding them is what turns a collection of people into a community or a nation.

* Bravery -- do the right thing no matter what (see opening quotes in sacred masc chapter)

* Cultivate integrity by a simple 5 step process:

1. *Commit:* Hold yourself to a standard of complete integrity: telling the truth, keeping your promises, and acting in service of what matters to you.

2. *Notice:* Notice when you're out of integrity -- when you don't tell the truth, or you're late to a meeting, or you act selfishly somehow.

3. *Release shame:*: Don't feel shame. If you notice yourself feeling shame, let that go. Remind yourself that you're not bad; you just made a mistake and you can grow from it. Releasing any shame is extremely important.

4. *Decide:* Decide what lessons to learn from your mistakes. Why did you not show up with integrity? What could help you show up better next time?

5. *Recommit:* Commit to living fully in integrity again.




### Cultivate Bravery

* many think of bravery as fearlessly facing danger, but that's a limiting perspective.

I think of bravery this way: _A person showing bravery remains fully conscious and acts in service of what matters under any challenge._

In other words, a brave person "does what's right" or "does the right thing" no matter what -- even at great personal risk.

#### Protect Each Other

* Standing up for one's self and others is the ultimate act of self-respect. The fact that so many people tolerate so much abuse indicates how little self-respect there is in unhealthy cultures. 

Awareness, integrity, bravery -- these are skills that can be practiced.


#### Decide What's Worth Dying For

You're going to die. The question is what's worth dying for, what's worth risking your life for, and what's not?
