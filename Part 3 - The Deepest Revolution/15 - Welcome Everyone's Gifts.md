## Chapter 15: Welcome Everyone's Gifts

Some people have more money or privilege than others, but no one is doing well in their unhealthy culture.

Each of us has sacred gifts to give, life purposes or ways of making the world a better place. Giving one's gifts is how a person gives their love in life, and if a person's gifts are rejected, their love is rejected.

While each person has their own unique gifts, there are common masculine and feminine gifts too. While everybody has both masculine and feminine energies, most humans align more closely with one or the other.

It turns out that both masculine and feminine gifts are unwelcome in unhealthy cultures, and so it is common for both men and women to feel unsatisfied. 

### Welcome the Feminine Gifts

Women suffer dramatically in unhealthy cultures. Sexism exists in every unhealthy culture, and the sexism universally favors men over women. In some times and places, wives have been treated as the property of their husbands, having no independent legal rights at all. This was true in 19th century United States and present-day Saudi Arabia.

A report from the Organization of American States found that every court system in North, Central, and South America propagates rape myths.[xxx-ohchr americas violence women] Rape myths are widely believed falsehoods about rape. Common examples include, "it didn't really happen, or the woman lied to cover up infidelity," "no harm was done, or sex between partners can't be rape," "women secretly want to be forced, and they could prevent rape if they chose," and "women who get raped deserve it somehow."[xxx-boys will be boys] As the report summarizes, "This combination of factors leaves the victims with a sense of insecurity, defenselessness and mistrust in the administration of justice..."[xxx-ohchr americas violence women] The report found that this was true in every court system in North, Central, and South America, and I believe it is true in every unhealthy culture.

Many women have resisted this mistreatment and worked to get their unhealthy culture to treat them respectfully and welcome their gifts. Unfortunately, unhealthy cultures often do not appreciate women's feminine gifts, including nurturing, caretaking, and bringing people together. Many feminist women have fallen into a trap where they feel the need to prove they are "as good as" men to deserve equal respect, instead of insisting on equal respect while celebrating our differences.

As a result, many women in unhealthy cultures have aspired to a life of wage slavery, trying to find meaningless jobs just like male wage slaves who've had meaningless jobs for centuries.

Unfortunately, when women only aspire to having the same roles as men, they simply take on exploitative jobs that men have traditionally held. Women engineers design nuclear power plants that produce toxic waste which will pollute the Earth for millennia. Women business executives oversee the production of plastics and other chemicals causing endless health problems. Women police officers abuse protesters who are standing for what's right and seeking justice. Women politicians like Margaret Thatcher or Nancy Pelosi implement laws that benefit the rich.

For as long as I live in an unhealthy culture, I will support women in finding meaningful paid work. Women are equally capable as men in many areas of life and equally deserving of respect. However, encouraging girls to become female wage slaves, selfish female business executives, and corrupt female politicians is clearly not the path to freedom.**

#### Honor the Feminine Strengths

Authorities in unhealthy cultures often label many feminine qualities as weaknesses rather than strengths.

I once shared my perspective on gift economies with a mother, and she said that mothers already know about gift economies. Children can never repay their mothers for all the energy and resources mothers give them. Embracing that beautiful gift economy attitude, many mothers recognize that the gifts they give their children will keep passing on. This is one way many women create healthy subcultures in their lives.

Feminine qualities of nurturing and deep inclusiveness show up not just in many families, but also social movements where women play a prominent role. Many women activists have been clear that they're not just fighting for their own betterment, but they're working to make things better for everybody -- that is, they're standing for everybody's needs.

Women's nurturing and tending qualities are strengths, not weaknesses. These qualities are part of every healthy culture there has ever been. A woman's radiant beauty is a blessing everywhere she goes, not an invitation to assault. Women's sensitivity is a gift that shows when things are not quite right and something needs addressing; it is not a sign of irrationality. Women's anger is likewise a core part of healthy cultures, as anger can point to trouble that needs addressing.

Embracing the sacred feminine in an unhealthy culture is an act of courage, healing, and love. It is strong to embrace being female, not weak. There is nothing more powerful or revolutionary than being yourself and giving your deepest love.

The Haudenosaunee and Zapatista men and women founders knew they needed strong women to play a strong role in their healthy culture. The stories of these healthy cultures' foundings both involved women playing a key role, and the men recognized and welcomed this. Women who try to be "like men" or "as good as men" are not simply being themselves. Yet this is where real strength comes from -- from _being yourself, by giving your deepest love_. Healthy cultures need strong women being themselves.

Whether a particular woman sees her role as tending children or being a military commander, healer, teacher, engineer, administrator, or something else or a mix, women who give their deepest love can contribute in countless ways.

But sexism will not end and freedom will not come just because women succeed in holding the same exploitative jobs as men. Sexism and male privilege are universal features of every unhealthy culture there has ever been. Deep freedom and the end of sexism will come when everybody stands for a culture of mutual respect, and nobody rules over anybody else.

### Welcome the Masculine Gifts

Men suffer dramatically as well, as key masculine gifts are likewise unwelcome in unhealthy cultures.

A core masculine gift is that of setting boundaries, especially protecting one's people from threats. In all cultures, few things inspire men more than the need to protect their people from danger. And yet, in unhealthy cultures, the rulers are the greatest threat to the people. The greatest threat is not from outside; it is within the culture itself.

As a result, abusive cultures raise boys not to honor their innate spiritual calling to protect their people from threats as a gift of love, without any compensation or orders. Instead, men commonly grow up learning to tolerate, ignore, or perpetuate abuse.

_It is not legal to be a good man in an unhealthy culture_, because good men stand up against any injustice or threat to their people, and authorities forbid this. Thus many men learn to tolerate, ignore, or perpetuate abuse to our neighbors, against all our natural instincts.

When boys are raised to deny or twist this deep love-gift of boundary-setting and protection, unhealthy cultures wind up with deeply spiritually confused men who ask questions like "When does life become meaningful?" or "Why am I even here?" Recall that spirituality is simply how a person relates to themselves and the world. When a man's deep gift of protective boundary-setting is not welcome in their unhealthy culture, it is difficult for a man to know how to relate to himself and the world.

This ultimately is the spiritual reality behind Henry David Thoreau's comment that "The mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation."[xxx-walden] It also explains the famous statement that "Every man dies. Not every man really lives."[xxx-braveheart every man] Living a life where a person has learned to hold back their love and not stand for what's right is deeply unsatisfying.

This also explains why women in unhealthy cultures around the world keep asking, "Where are all the good men?" In feminist literature, popular music and movies, this is a common question going back to the dawn of unhealthy cultures.

Of course, women can set boundaries and protect their people too. And yet, when this protective boundary-setting is forbidden in unhealthy cultures, a core masculine gift is rejected, and many men become spiritually lost.

People endlessly debate the meaning of "toxic masculinity," and this perspective gets to the heart of the trouble: unhealthy cultures do not train boys to be good men, because good men stand for what's right and protect their people from any threat, and authorities forbid this. Boys learn to cope with this deep trouble in a variety of ways. Some become selfish or become people pleasers, or distract themselves from their meaningless life with things like alcohol, drugs, superficial hobbies, or overwork.

Rain-in-the-Face was a Sioux warrior who fought to protect his people from the encroaching American military. Finally, after much fighting, his people decided to submit and move onto an Indian reservation. He described what happened to his spirit when he finally gave up protecting his people and standing for what's right: "I fought for my people and my country... Rain-In-The-Face was killed when he put down his weapons before the Great Father [US president]. His spirit was gone then; only his poor body lived on..."[xxx-indian heroes and great chieftains|rain-in-the-face]

Every transition into unhealthy cultures required this deep spiritual wounding in men where they are expected to hold back their love and not protect their people from the biggest threats. Rain-In-The-Face could at least recognize his wound because he had grown up in a culture that welcomed his deepest love. He knew what giving his love and setting protective boundaries was like, so he knew something was wrong when these gifts were unwelcome in the unhealthy culture.

Most boys in unhealthy cultures never learn what it's like to give their deepest love because they're trained for obedience instead of standing for what's right. Training children for obedience actually trains them for cowardice, as they learn to take the comfortable and safe path (of doing what they're told to stay out of trouble) instead of bravely standing for what's right, even contrary to the authorities. When children are trained for obedience, is it any wonder that cowardice is common in adulthood, and people have low trust in each other?

#### Brave Men Inspire Women's Trust, and Trusting Women Inspire Men's Bravery

When I first heard women asking, "where are all the good men?" I didn't understand the question because I didn't know what a good man was. It wasn't until I found stories of healthy cultures that I learned what it's like when every man in the nation is deeply trustworthy, because every man cultivates the spiritual strength to stand for what's right and protect his people whenever it's needed.

As I kept finding stories of good men, two themes repeatedly came up: bravery and integrity. Nez Perce chief Joseph led his people on an epic journey to escape American military subjugation and very nearly succeeded. Later his advice to a young American boy was simple: "Be brave and tell the truth."[xxx-joseph brave truth|p336]

A Cheyenne boy's uncle likewise taught him there was "one thing more important than anything else, and that is to be brave... If you do that, the people will all know of it, and will look on you as a man." He also said, "always be truthful and honest with all your people."[xxx-when buffalo ran|lessons prairie]

Other men showed me how far they took integrity and bravery. Apache man Geronimo described how each young man was trained to prove "beyond question that he can bear hardships without complaint, and that he is a stranger to fear."[xxx-geronimo autobio|preparation of a warrior] Sioux man Ohiyesa hinted at his deep training for servant-leadership when he said he was "trained to be a warrior and a hunter, and not to care for money or possessions, but to be in the broadest sense a public servant."[xxx-from deep woods to civilization|the way opens]

Can you imagine living in a society where all boys are raised to have full integrity and unquestionable bravery, so that every man was fully trustworthy?

Stories from healthy cultures don't just show men's bravery, they show how trusting women can be when they're surrounded by fully trustworthy men.

Pretty Shield was a Crow woman, and she described what it was like when the men were absolutely trustworthy, taking deep responsibility for themselves and the wellbeing of their people. She described how her village would move between sites with all their homes and gear packed on horses. They could be attacked at any time, so male Crow scouts would travel ahead, around and behind the main group to give warning if enemies approached. They called these Crow scouts "wolves," and she said, "we women visited while we traveled... The men were ever watching these wolves, and we women constantly watched the men."[xxx-red mother|p22] The women trusted the men to organize themselves into a protection force and pay attention to each other to collectively protect the village, all without pay or threat of punishment by a commanding officer.

Many stories show the profoundly beautiful way of life that exists when brave men inspire women's trust, and trusting women intentionally inspire men's bravery.

Wikis was a boy of five or six years old when his Cheyenne village was attacked. He remembered seeing the men instantly jump on their horses and ride towards the danger while the women gathered the children. He said, "My mother rushed out and caught me by the hand... and then she stopped and in a shrill, sweet voice began to sing; and other women that were running about stopped too, and began to sing songs to encourage their husbands and brothers and sons to fight bravely; for enemies were attacking the camp."

The warriors were heavily outnumbered, and so they repeatedly engaged the enemy and retreated to avoid being overwhelmed. Wikis said, "there were many of these strangers, while our people were only a few. But still my people kept stopping and turning and fighting. Now the noise was louder. The women sang their strong heart songs more shrilly, and I could hear more plainly the whoops of men..." Wikis' mother then ran away with the children across a river. Help came from a larger nearby village and pushed the attackers away. Several warriors died that night protecting their people.[xxx-when buffalo ran|attack on the camp]

Women's beauty and trust can be deeply inspirational to men who have trained to bravely give their love in service to their people. Black Elk described how the Lakota women would cheer on their men both during preparation and during battle. In the Battle of Little Bighorn in 1876, Black Elk described an attack by the American military led by lieutenant colonel George Armstrong Custer. As the attackers approached, they kicked up a huge dust cloud. Women and children ran into their village while the warriors ran out. Warriors shouted war cries and Black Elk described how he once ran to a group of women: "When I got to the women on the hill they were all singing and making the tremolo to cheer the men fighting across the river."[xxx-black elk speaks|the rubbing out of long hair]

These and many other stories show me that it's possible for all the men of a culture to live with integrity and bravery. The women would not have sung for untrustworthy men. These stories showed me what men are capable of when every man embraces deep integrity and bravery in service of the people they love, and how women's trust in men need not be misplaced.

Not just a few individual men, but all the men in a nation can be trustworthy. Unfortunately, unhealthy cultures forbid people from standing for what's right, so they encourage and even require low-integrity and low-bravery in their men, or only allow bravery in limited ways, for example in the military where soldiers still have to submissively follow authorities' orders.

Obviously, women can fight too, and underestimating a woman fighter is a quick path to defeat. Women can likewise cultivate integrity and bravery, so I do _not_ mean to suggest that these are only masculine qualities. 

In desperate situations where everyone in a culture must stay and fight for the group's survival, then everyone stays and fights. In situations where everyone must escape, then everyone escapes together. But if someone must stay and confront a threat so that others may escape, it's the male warriors' responsibility to stay and fight. Women may fight, inspire the fighting men, escape with the children and elders, or take any other actions depending on how they believe they can best serve the group. This protective boundary-setting is a core masculine responsibility, and in order to show up well in life, boys must be raised to bravely honor this responsibility as a gift to their people.

### Let's Have High Standards for Each Other

These stories showed me what it's like to live in a nation where everybody deeply trusts everybody else. It's possible to have that widespread trust when people show up with deep integrity as a normal way of life. But this sort of widespread trust and integrity doesn't "just happen." To have a whole culture or whole nation with widespread trust and integrity requires people to hold each other to a high standard of excellent and beautiful behavior.

People tend to rise or fall to the expectations others have for them. When people have high expectations and high standards for each other, and each person is really expected to give their deepest love and stand for what's right every day, then I believe this sort of deep trust can exist.

Of course, anybody in any culture can hold themselves and others to a high standard. Ruling classes can impose whatever laws they want, but you and the people around you can choose how you will show up in life.

Find your power and recognize your sacred gifts. Give your sacred gifts every day, and invite the people around you to do the same. When everybody in a group bravely gives their deepest love every day, the people will be able to relax into a widespread trust in each other that feels deeply satisfying.
