### Reciprocity: Private Property Rights vs Sacred Responsibilities

Okanaga - Armstrong: "it's not just that we're part of the land... but that the land is us."

Potawatomi - Kimmerer: 
> So I made it hypothetical and asked, "What do you suppose would happen if people believed this crazy notion that the earth loved them back?" The floodgates opened. They all wanted to talk at once. We were suddenly off the deep end, heading for world peace and perfect harmony.

> One student summed it up: "You wouldn't harm what gives you love."

> Knowing that you love the earth changes you, activates you to defend and protect and celebrate. But when you feel that the earth loves you in return, that feeling transforms the relationship from a one-way street into a sacred bond.

Cherokee - Rebecca Adamson: It also explains why Cherokee woman Rebecca Adamson said, "tribal people worship the sacredness of creation as a way of life, not as a philosophy or religion." She pointed out that no languages of healthy cultures even have words for religion. The nearest word for "belief" translates to "the way you live."

### Living as a Gift to the Earth

* baskets

* bow harvest

* running - thus 75 miles/day for days in a row

### Creating a Culture of Remembering
* healthy cultures are who we are -- the three core spiritual practices resonate with every human who lets anything resonate at all. Trust and integrity, no matter what. Who doesn't want to be able to trust their neighbors to act with kindness and generosity and stand for a culture of mutual respect, no matter what comes?

* many subcultures adopt many healthy-culture practices - call them healthy subcultures - labor unions, mutual aid societies, civil rights organizations, etc.

### Cultivate Deep Awareness and Unity Through Nature Connection Practices

What's it like living in a healthy culture that encourages unity without hurtful ideologies and without ignoring abuse? What do healthy cultures actually do to generate solidarity and help people get along in a deep way?

I was pleasantly surprised when I noticed that nature connection practices helped me connect with people in a deeper way than I ever had before. After practicing for years, it's clear to me that if a whole group of people embraced these practices, they could be closely connected indeed.

The _Kamana_ program produced by Jon Young introduces students to a very special nature connection practice called the sit spot. I picked a place outdoors within a few minutes' walk from my home where I could view wildlife. My first sit spot was next to a stream winding through a big forest, but during times when I've moved around a lot, I've also used my backyard or a nearby park.

The goal is to go to the sit spot daily and explore and notice what's going on. What plants grow at what times of the year? What birds live there, and how do they interact with each other and the plants? What animals live there or pass through? I learned to pay attention with all my senses, my eyes, ears, taste, smell, touch, temperature, and more. And I learned to feel curious about the experiences of the beings around me.

I asked myself questions about what I saw. Why would a bird constantly look up as it eats? I learned that they are continuously aware in case predators arrive, so birds constantly eat, look around, eat, and look again. Do some species of tree like growing together and others don't? For example, I learned that black walnuts produce a compound which only some plants find toxic, and thus black walnuts like growing with trees like sugar maple and box elder but avoid trees like white pines.

I continually practiced feeling into the experiences of other beings. For example, I studied hawks and songbirds, and I imagined being a songbird and how terrifying it would be to have a sharp-shinned hawk swoop out of the sky and snatch me in an instant. If I were a songbird, I would probably eat carefully too!

Eventually, I learned that plants and animals could help me notice parts of the landscape I couldn't observe directly. The movement of a bird might indicate a hidden possum moving through low brush. Or, some birds and other animals like deer can see ultraviolet light that is invisible to humans. I might not be able to see rodent poop directly, but birds can see the ultraviolet light reflected off the poop. If I notice birds responding to it, I can learn about the rodents' presence with the birds' help.

The first core spiritual practice -- cultivating a practical, aware gratitude -- is a big part of this sit spot training. I learned that birds and plants and other beings could teach me about my environment, or they could show me when I'm feeling anxious or stressed. They could help me become more aware about my environment or myself if only I became more aware of them. This awareness is a gift that they give. I learned to feel into the birds and plants and streams around me so that they were extensions of me. Their awareness became an extension of my awareness, and the only limit was how carefully I could pay attention, and how well I could interpret the behaviors I observed.

This is training in deep empathy, and I noticed it also helped me with people. For example, growing up, I learned that women can get extra sensitive during their period. For years I found this annoying and learned to leave women alone during this time. But as with my nature connection practices, I started asking, "how is this a gift?" or "what does this have to teach me?" And I noticed that some women friends would reject food during their period that they normally ate, and when I asked, they said the food was rancid. I would try it and I couldn't taste any rancidity at first. Over time, I learned to taste my food more and more, and I began to notice the occasional rancidity, especially in store-bought food. I realized that the sensitive women had noticed something I couldn't notice. Like the birds, women could show me something about my environment that I couldn't notice directly. When a woman said some food was rancid, even if I couldn't detect it, I began to trust her, and I rejected the food too. Over time this helped me notice rancidity I couldn't notice before.

The more I practiced, the more this deep empathy helped me see. For example, when black people complain about police brutality, it shows me where my society isn't as healthy or fair as it seems in my experience. When children complain about being forced to sit through boring classes at school, they show me where adults can behave hurtfully without knowing it. I started treating everyone around me like an extension of me, whether men or women or children or nonhumans. I paid attention to what other people observed or how they behaved and let it show me things I couldn't see by myself. I don't blindly trust everyone, but I take care to notice what lessons I can learn from others.

Noticing all the different ways a person makes the world a better place is one way to receive their gifts. After everyone else went home, which coworker stayed late to get the project done on time? Which activists show up to meetings early so we can start on time? Who maintains a sense of humor in stressful moments, or gives solid constructive feedback instead of lashing out angrily when someone makes a mistake? I just practice noticing and either giving thanks or offering constructive feedback when that seems appropriate.

Receiving nonhumans' gifts is similar. I notice all the ways each tree, stream or deer makes the world a better place. I also notice when they're annoying, like the deer who recently ate my garden, but even that deer had a lesson for me. They taught me where my security was lacking.

I've had women tell me "you're not a woman, so you can't know what it's like." In a sense, that's true. I'm a man, so I can't know what a woman's experience is like. But by the same logic, I cannot know other men's experiences either. I'm not a black man, so I can't know what a black man's experience is like. I'm neither rich nor impoverished, so I can't know what the rich or poor men's experiences are like. I wasn't born into a healthy culture, so I can't know what that experience is like. And I can't know the experiences of birds or trees.

Ultimately, I can only know my own experience, but this doesn't have to limit me when I practice deep empathy. With enough practice asking questions and paying attention, I can see others' perspectives even if their experiences are really different than mine. I might not always agree with someone else's perspectives, but I can at least understand them and understand their behavior. And when I get it wrong, that just becomes another chance to grow my observation skills and learn.

I believe these nature connection practices are a key part of generating unity in a culture. Once I started really noticing the perspectives of insects and bears and plants, I found it easier to understand people's perspectives. I believe when everybody is raised with these nature connection practices, empathy can be common, and this helps healthy cultures find and maintain a deep unity. They also help me make fewer foolish assumptions. Assumptions are simply unexamined beliefs. When I continuously pay attention to what I observe, I notice what I know and what I don't know. There's little room for unexamined beliefs.

The Haudenosaunee showed me the kind of unity that comes from these nature connection practices. They have a very special Thanksgiving Address where they methodically go through different forms of life and give thanks to each. They thank the medicine herbs for removing sickness and the fish for purifying water. They give thanks to the trees for providing shelter and food. They give thanks to all the divine beings who give so much to create the web of life that we're all part of.[xxx-braiding sweetgrass|allegiance to gratitude]

The Haudenosaunee open every gathering with the Thanksgiving Address, calling it The Words That Come Before All Else. While each rendition is unique, the version I learned ends in this way:

> Now we have arrived in a very special place where dwells the Great Spirit that moves through all things. As one mind we turn our thoughts to the Creator with Thanksgiving and Greetings.

> We have now become like one being, with one body, one heart, one mind. We send our Prayers and special Thanksgiving Greetings to all the unborn Children of all the Future Generations. We send our thoughts to the many different Beings we may have missed during our Thanksgiving. With one mind we send our Thanksgiving and Greetings to all of the Nations of the World.

> Now our minds are one.[xxx-kamana 2 nat|p2]

Healthy cultures generate unity in many ways. In this example, I believe the Haudenosaunee become a people of one heart by collectively recognizing divinity in all things, recognizing their sacred place in divinity, and giving thanks together. This is the opposite of divisive racism! This Thanksgiving Address helps me remember to feel gratitude and feel connected with life. It softens my heart, and it does much more too. It shows me how a culture's leaders can encourage unity and awareness rather than division and ignorance.

Even the little nuances of the Address taught me a great deal. Robin Kimmerer learned from the elders of the Onandaga, a member nation of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy, that it would be a mistake to see this Thanksgiving Address as a prayer.[xxx-braiding sweetgrass|allegiance to gratitude] When I prayed growing up, I closed my eyes, bowed my head in a submissive posture, and drew my attention inward to pray to my idea of God. As I practiced this Thanksgiving Address, I learned to give thanks with all my senses awake and open to the living world around me. I held my head high. This showed me that spirituality and submission don't have to go together. I believe that a submissive posture during prayer or thanksgiving is an artifact of authoritarian religious teachings that encourage people to be submissive.

This Thanksgiving Address showed me something else. The Haudenosaunee people collectively give thanks for the divine gifts of the nonhumans. This showed me that God is not off in the sky; Creator is alive in Creation. I believe that's what it means to recognize the Great Spirit That Moves Through All Beings, a perspective I've found in many healthy cultures. In Christianity, this is called the Holy Spirit. And since Creator is alive in Creation, when people stand in solidarity with the Earth, they're standing in solidarity with Creator.

Being in solidarity with life means being in solidarity with God. Being One with the Earth and being One with God are the same thing. The same three core spiritual practices that generate solidarity among people in healthy cultures also generate solidarity between people and all life, and with divinity itself.
