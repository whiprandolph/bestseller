### Maintain Awareness Despite the Propaganda

What would it be like if, every single day, the news media covered the most important issues?

Imagine what would happen if you woke up and started reading or watching the news, and _every single day_ the news media reminded you of the key facts covered in this book:

* _Injustice is pervasive in the "justice" system_: The "justice" system commonly ignores the crimes of the rich and powerful, while unfairly punishing huge numbers of people.

* _Authorities continue to impose sexism, racism, and hatred_: In countless different ways, our unaccountable leaders commonly impose and maintain sexist, racist, and hateful attitudes, encouraging people to act hurtfully towards each other or supposed enemies.

* _Authorities are killing or imprisoning our greatest spiritual leaders_: Authorities are imprisoning or killing our spiritual leaders, the wisest and bravest among us who seek to end the worst injustices.

* _We are still slaves_: the vast majority of people remain enslaved in one form or another, whether wage slaves, chattel slaves, prison slaves, or military slaves.

* _Many authority figures either commit or cover up child sexual abuse_: Whether priests, politicians, or wealthy business men, many of the most influential people commonly either sexually abuse children or protect those who do.

* _Still not free_: Because we're still expected to obey laws we didn't choose, and punished for standing for what's right, we are trained to excuse or ignore that so much abuse and injustice continues. Thus we are still not free today.

* _It doesn't have to be this way_: It is possible to live without these troubles, if people could only form new healthy cultures where everyone agrees on their laws and upholds them with integrity, taking the humans' and nonhumans' needs into account.

Of course, it would be hard to watch these reminders every day! Imagine if news sources consistently reminded viewers of the most beautiful truths too:

* _Each person has sacred gifts to give_: Each person has sacred gifts, a life purpose or way of making the world a better place that only they can give. It is our responsibility to cultivate and give our gifts and help others give theirs so that everyone is giving their deepest love together.

* _Integrity, bravery, trust, authenticity, generosity, awareness, and gratitude could be widespread and pervasive_: 

* _The Earth loves us and wants to be in a mutually nourishing relationship with us_: 

If the news covered the most important topics, this is what viewers would see every day. In unhealthy cultures, _there is only one political problem: that people are not free_. We suffer endless abuse, confusion, threats, injustice, and isolation, different people in different ways.

Propaganda takes many forms, but ultimately its goal is to train people to ignore these deep truths and tolerate widespread injustice. The news encourages people to focus on distractions such as professional sports, support ineffective political movements and parties, see fellow citizens as a threat instead of the rich and powerful, focus on this or that aspect of corruption while ignoring the worst injustices, and more.

This shows the importance of where you put your attention. I'm not suggesting you dwell on terrible things all the time -- that would quickly lead to depression! But anytime you consider the political and social situation in your unhealthy culture, keep those bullet points in mind. 

### Nature Connection Practices: My Personal Journey to Greater Connection and Empathy

Born and raised in unhealthy cultures, what can people do to release any sexist, racist, or hateful cultural training, and instead cultivate deep awareness and understanding of others?**

I was pleasantly surprised to discover how much the nature connection practices described in Chapter 3 helped me connect more deeply with people than I ever had before. After practicing for years, it's clear to me that if a whole group of people regularly embraced these practices, they could feel closely connected indeed, leaving no place for sexism, racism and hatred.

Every day, I would go to the same spot and pay attention to the nonhumans. I ask, what plants grow at what times of the year? What birds live there, and how do they interact with each other and the plants? What animals live there or pass through? I learned to pay attention with all my senses, my eyes, ears, taste, smell, touch, temperature, and more. And I learned to feel curious about the experiences of the beings around me.

Sitting there each day, I wondered, for example, why a bird would constantly look up as they eat. Through observation, I learned that they stay continuously aware in case predators arrive. I also saw that some species of tree grew near each other, while others did not. Black walnuts, for example, produce a compound which only some plants find toxic, so they grow near sugar maple and box elder but avoid white pines.

I continually practiced feeling into the experiences of other living beings. I imagined being a songbird and how terrifying it would be to have a sharp-shinned hawk swoop out of the sky and snatch me up in an instant. If I were a songbird, I would probably eat carefully too!**

Eventually, I learned that plants and animals could help me notice parts of the landscape I couldn't observe directly. The movement of a bird might indicate a hidden possum moving through low brush. Or, some birds and other animals like deer can see ultraviolet light that is invisible to humans. I might not be able to see rodent poop directly, but birds can see the ultraviolet light reflected off the poop. If I notice birds responding to it, I can learn about the rodents' presence with the birds' help.

The first core spiritual practice -- cultivating a practical, aware gratitude -- is a big part of this daily awareness training. I learned that birds and plants and other beings could teach me about my environment, or they could show me when I'm feeling anxious or stressed. They could help me become more aware about my environment or myself if only I became more aware of them. This awareness is a gift that they give. I learned to feel into the birds and plants and streams around me so that they were extensions of me. Their awareness became an extension of my awareness, and the only limit was how carefully I could pay attention, and how well I could interpret the behaviors I observed.

This is training in deep empathy, and I noticed it also helped me with people. For example, growing up, I learned that women can get extra sensitive during their period. For years I found this annoying and learned to leave women alone during this time. But as with my nature connection practices, I started asking, "how is this a gift?" or "what does this have to teach me?" And I noticed that some women friends would reject food during their period that they normally ate, and when I asked, they said the food was rancid. I would try it and I couldn't taste any rancidity at first. Over time, I learned to taste my food more and more, and I began to notice the occasional rancidity, especially in store-bought food. I realized that the sensitive women had noticed something I couldn't notice. Like the birds, women could show me something about my environment that I couldn't notice directly. When a woman said some food was rancid, even if I couldn't detect it, I began to trust her, and I rejected the food too. Over time this helped me notice rancidity I couldn't notice before.

The more I practiced, the more deeply I could see. For example, when black Americans complain about police brutality, it shows me where my society isn't as healthy or fair as it seems in my experience. When children complain about being forced to sit through boring classes at school, they show me where adults can behave hurtfully without knowing it. I started treating everyone around me like an extension of me, whether men or women or children or nonhumans. I paid attention to what other people observed or how they behaved and let it show me things I couldn't see by myself. I don't blindly trust anyone, but I take care to notice what lessons I can learn from others.

I've had women tell me "you're not a woman, so you can't know what it's like." In a sense, that's true. I'm a man, so I can't know what a woman's experience is like. But by the same logic, I cannot know other men's experiences either. I'm not a black man, so I can't know what a black man's experience is like. I'm neither rich nor impoverished, so I can't know what the rich or poor men's experiences are like. I wasn't born into a healthy culture, so I can't know what that experience is like. And I can't know the experiences of birds or trees.

Ultimately, I can only know my own experience, but this doesn't have to limit me when I practice deep empathy. With enough practice asking questions and paying attention, I can see others' perspectives even if their experiences are really different than mine. I might not always agree with someone else's perspectives, but I can at least understand them and understand their behavior. And when I get it wrong, that just becomes another chance to grow my observation skills and learn.

These nature connection practices are a key part of generating unity in a culture. Once I started really noticing the perspectives of insects and bears and plants, it was easier to understand people's perspectives. When everybody embraces these deep awareness practices, mutual understanding becomes common, and this can help any group find and maintain a deep unity.
