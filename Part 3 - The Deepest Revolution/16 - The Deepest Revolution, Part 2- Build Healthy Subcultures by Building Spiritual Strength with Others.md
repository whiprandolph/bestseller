## Chapter 16: The Deepest Revolution, Part 2: Build Healthy Subcultures by Building Spiritual Strength with Others

Can you imagine what life would be like if you deeply trusted everyone around you to stand for what's right and take care of each other no matter what?

Okanagan woman Jeannette Armstrong described this deep trust vividly when she said, "The realization that people and community are there to sustain you creates the most secure feeling in the world."[xxx-original instructions|armstrong]

In order to have this deep trust, people of healthy cultures consistently hold each other to high standards of excellent and beautiful behavior. In other words, they have high expectations or standards for each other for qualities like integrity, generosity, awareness, authenticity, physical resilience, joyfulness, personal growth, walking a meaningful path, and bravery.

When qualities like deep integrity and generosity become widespread, it's easy to see how trust becomes widespread too.

A key aspect of creating a new healthy culture is remembering or learning how to hold yourself and others to a high standard. Plenty of stories from healthy cultures show just how high our standards could be for each other.

_Integrity:_ In every legal system around the world, people are required to testify under oath, and they are threatened with severe punishment for lying. The assumption is that participants might lie if they weren't threatened with severe punishment.

In contrast, integrity was so pervasive among the traditional Apache that they did not compel anyone to take an oath because, according to Geronimo, "it is not believed that they will give false testimony in a matter relating to their own people."[xxx-geronimo autobio|Unwritten Laws of the Apaches]

Can you imagine if there was no need for an oath to tell the truth, because people in your group already expected total honesty from each other as a normal way of life?

_Physical resilience:_: Crow woman Pretty Shield described how physically resilient her people were when they lived in a traditional way. She said, "Ahh, my people were tough in those days... [W]hen I was young, if in winter a person fell into icy water, he got out, took off his wet clothes, and rolled in the snow, rubbing his body with it, and got warm. Then, after squeezing out the water, he put on his clothes and forgot about getting wet. Now my people wear gloves, and too many clothes. We are soft as mud."[xxx-red mother|p84]

Can you imagine if the people around you were so physically resilient that even being soaking wet in winter was nothing to worry about, but just a little trouble to fix?

_Generosity:_ A Christian missionary once visited men of the Ojibway, Cheyenne, Cree and Sioux nations, and he described Jesus Christ's selfless generosity. Christ gave away all his possessions and urged others to do the same while dedicating his life to feeding, healing, and protecting his people. The missionary was told that, prior to colonization, Jesus Christ's level of selfless generosity was simply normal among them.[xxx-from deep woods to civilization|civ preached practiced]

Can you imagine living in a nation where someone like Jesus Christ was considered admirable but not remarkable because such selfless generosity is simply normal and expected?

_Meaningful Education for Young People:_ One Nootka storyteller described how the women would often have their moon time at the same time each month, and they would go to a special house and enjoy a four-day party. They would sit on special soft moss and give their blood back to the Earth and play games and talk. Women would rub each others' back and make special tea if someone had cramps. This became a major opportunity for older women to mentor younger women. For example, young women learned the special Frog posture that could help relieve cramps and make childbirth easier.

Could you imagine if adults took young people's education seriously, offering them the most meaningful mentorship they could every day?

_Benefitting the Earth:_ Stories abound of people of healthy cultures actually benefitting the Earth as a normal way of life rather than depleting it. Robin Kimmerer described how Black Ash trees actually became _more abundant_ in regions where it was respectfully harvested by Mohawk and Potawatomi basket makers, and this remains true today.[xxx-braiding sweetgrass|wisgaak gokpenagen] Apache man Stalking Wolf described how he respectfully harvested a sapling to make a bow in such a way that the overall forest benefitted, and the chosen tree yielded a powerful bow.[xxx-the vision|p80]

Can you imagine if your normal way of life benefitted the Earth around you, increasing the natural abundance that you depended on?

When people really bring out the best in each other, have high expectations, or hold each other to a high standard, we humans really are capable of maintaining that baseline of mutual respect among each other, and between people and the Earth.

In a sense, members of nations such as the Potawatomi, Apache, and Nootka are people like anyone else. They have attitudes, skills and awareness that anybody could cultivate -- including you and the people around you.

You could hold yourself and others to a high standard of integrity. You and the people around you could cultivate physical resilience, mentor young people in a good way, and learn how to receive the Earth's gifts in a way that actually benefits the Earth.

This is the path to building a culture of deep trust. Have high expectations for yourself and the people around you so that qualities like integrity, bravery, awareness, and generosity are simply normal and expected.

<div class="rev-act"><div class="rev-act-header">Revolutionary Activity #25<br/>Hold yourself and others to a high standard</div>
<div class="rev-act-body">Think of a time when someone had faith in you, maybe even more faith than you had in yourself. Did someone help you find the self-respect to leave an abusive romantic relationship? Did a coach help you cultivate the discipline to train at your sport and be the best you could be? Did a teacher help you realize you could be great at whatever you put your mind to? If this mentor did their job properly, they did not shame or punish you, but helped you see your unmet potential and urged you to reach it -- to be your best self, and not settle for less. Think of an example like this where someone really brought out the best in you, holding you to a high standard.<br/><br/>Watch for an instance where someone lets themselves or others down. Perhaps they lie to someone or to themselves, or give up on a big goal too easily, or tolerate an unsatisfying relationship or job without even trying to change it. One way or another, help them find the strength to show up better.**</div></div>

#### When People Develop Low Standards

One consequence of being conquered is that people may be tempted to accept their own submissive obedience as legitimate and normal. When this happens, _people's standards for themselves and each other drop a lot._ In other words, when a person or group finally tolerates their own obedient submission, they stop expecting very much of themselves or others. People don't really expect life to be deeply meaningful, or don't trust other people, or learn to focus mostly on themselves or pleasing others instead of standing for what's right. People may engage in superficial or wishful thinking, and even adopt the ideologies of their abusers.

The underlying attitudes are things like, "Why go to the trouble of cultivating integrity and bravery if my comfortable life doesn't demand these qualities?" or "Why confront injustice if I don't trust others to stand with me, and if it wouldn't do any good anyway?" or "I don't trust anyone and need to look after myself."

Widespread low standards or low expectations have many tragic consequences for both men and women.

A core masculine gift is that of setting boundaries, especially protecting one's people from threats. In all cultures, few things inspire men more than the need to protect their people from danger. And yet, in unhealthy cultures, the rulers are the greatest threat to the people. The greatest threat is not from outside; it is within the culture itself.

As a result, abusive cultures raise boys not to honor their innate spiritual calling to protect their people from threats as a gift of love, without any compensation or orders. Instead, men commonly grow up learning to tolerate, ignore, or perpetuate abuse.

When boys are raised to deny or twist this deep love-gift of boundary-setting and protection, unhealthy cultures wind up with deeply spiritually confused men who ask questions like "When does life become meaningful?" or "Why am I even here?"

This ultimately is the spiritual reality behind Henry David Thoreau's comment that "The mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation."[xxx-walden] It also explains the famous statement that "Every man dies. Not every man really lives."[xxx-braveheart every man] Living a life where a person has learned to hold back their love and not stand for what's right is deeply unsatisfying.

This also explains why women in unhealthy cultures around the world keep asking, "Where are all the good men?" Whether in feminist literature from the Americas, Europe, or Asia, this is a common question going back to the dawn of unhealthy cultures.[xxx-odoc|ch47]

Of course, women can set boundaries and protect their people too. And yet, when this protective boundary-setting is forbidden in unhealthy cultures, a core masculine gift is rejected and many men become spiritually lost.

People endlessly debate the meaning of "toxic masculinity," and this perspective gets to the heart of the trouble: unhealthy cultures do not train boys to be good men, because good men stand for what's right and protect their people from any threat, and authorities forbid this. Boys learn to cope with this deep trouble in a variety of ways. Some become selfish or become people pleasers, or distract themselves from their meaningless life with things like alcohol, drugs, superficial hobbies, or overwork.

Every transition into unhealthy cultures requires deep spiritual wounding where people are expected to hold back their love and not protect their people from the biggest threats. Sioux man Rain-In-The-Face described it vividly, saying his "spirit was gone then; only his poor body lived on..." He could at least recognize his spiritual wound because he had grown up in a culture that welcomed his deepest love. He knew what giving his love and setting protective boundaries was like, so he knew something was wrong when these gifts were unwelcome in the American unhealthy culture.[xxx-indian heroes and great chieftains|rain-in-the-face]

Most boys in unhealthy cultures never learn what it's like to give their deepest love because they're trained for obedience instead of standing for what's right. Training children for obedience actually trains them for cowardice, as they learn to take the comfortable and safe path (ie doing what they're told to stay out of trouble) instead of bravely standing for what's right.

When children are trained for obedience, is it any wonder that cowardice is common in adulthood, and people have low trust in each other?

When boys are trained for cowardly obedience instead of bravely protecting their people from any threat or abuse, is it any surprise that so many women wonder where all the good men are? And when so many men are lost, is it any surprise that most men don't know what the women are talking about?

For years, I didn't understand this question myself -- what do you mean where are all the good men? I didn't know what a good man was until I studied healthy cultures where boys are consistenty raised to be good men who stand for what's right and protect their people from any threat. Stories of profoundly trustworthy men and trusting women from the Crow, Cheyenne, and Lakota showed me that all the men of a nation can be trustworthy.[xxx-odoc|ch47]

Of course, women can become spiritually lost too, such as those who believe women can be "liberated" by becoming well-paid wage slaves, selfish executives and corrupt politicians, just like spiritually lost men.

Instead of seeking real freedom where everyone stands for what's right as a normal way of life, authorities in unhealthy cultures trick everyone into thinking that "freedom" just means being able to do whatever you want without financial or cultural restraint, and so the way to be free is to get rich. But this is the faux-freedom of kings who don't have to care about anyone else or follow any laws.

Real freedom comes when everyone stands for what's right as a normal way of life, so that everyone can enjoy justice and deep respect from their neighbors. When people forget this and just look after themselves, it's easy to become spiritually lost and let selfishness take over.

I certainly do _not_ suggest anyone quit their job. Just realize that individuals getting better-paid jobs is not the path to collective freedom. 

Revolutionaries like the Black Panthers and Zapatistas often kept working their jobs to support themselves as they sought to free their people. Black Panther Don Cox put it well: "use what you got to get what you need." Making money and getting rich shouldn't be the end-goal. Just like the Tzutujil Mayans and Huron who liked to get rich so they could give it all away, or Harriet Tubman who saved up money so she could return South to help others escape chattel slavery, I support people in making money so they can do the most good in service of the people and nonhumans they love.

When you know what to look for, you will see how low our expectations are for each other in unhealthy cultures. But it doesn't need to be this way. To create healthy subcultures and eventually sovereign healthy cultures, we need to raise our standards!

Find a private moment or invite them to a private conversation, look them in the eye, and tell them you care about them and would support them in moments of need.</div></div>

#### Build a Healthy Subculture with Others

If you've completed the revolutionary activities so far, you're well on your way to building a healthy subculture with others. You've practiced standing for what's right and supporting others when they take a stand. You've practiced giving generously and receiving graciously. You've practiced cultivating gratitude, giving your sacred gifts, and forming relationships of reciprocity where people share with each other over time.

You've practiced noticing the Earth's gifts, and giving back to the Earth. You've questioned your assumptions and channeled your anger in productive ways.

You've joined with other people into groups that continually share with each other, and where people can safely speak their heart.



Building a healthy subculture with others can be challenging. I've failed several times, mostly due to my own blind spots. 


MAKE THIS AN EPIC RANT. IT's TIME to END THIS BULLSHIT

















In order for humans to have a culture, there have to be agreements on appropriate or inappropriate behavior, and systems of accountability.

In unhealthy cultures, governments impose laws that define good and bad behavior. In subcultures, it's normal for an authority figure to impose the rules. For example, in a kids' sports team, the coach defines the rules for the kids. In corporations, the CEO defines the rules for the employees. The enforcement of these rules form the structure of the culture or subculture; the rules and their enforcement form the boundaries of what is acceptable or unacceptable.

These "laws" or "rules" are simply descriptions or agreements of behavior that that the group accepts or doesn't accept. When you and others form a group where people commit to high standards of behavior, you're effectively creating your own law within your subculture.

This is the ancient and instinctive source of natural law in human societies: when everyone embraces integrity and stands for what's right, people's high standards for good behavior become the laws they live by.

"Integrity" is consistently recognized as the essence of something's structure. One engineering company defines _structural integrity_ as "the ability of a structure to withstand its intended load without experiencing failure."[xxx-arch struxure integrity] When a bridge or building "loses integrity," this means it is close to collapse. In psychology, integrity is related to someone's balance, wholeness, or solid sense of self.

Integrity is likewise the essence of a healthy culture's structure. People can agree to live in a respectful way, but will they keep their agreements and actually uphold respectful boundaries? When integrity is widespread and people uphold their agreements for how to live, they can relax into that deep trust.

Integrity is the complement of trust. For every way that people want to trust each other, there's a  kind of integrity. "Speaking the truth" and "keeping promises" are two forms of integrity, which are essential to forming trusting relationships. However, people in the same culture also expect each other to act in service even without promising to do so, and this is an essential aspect of trust. An infant trusts her mother to act in service without making any promise. Students trust their teacher to act in service. Patients expect their doctor to heal them instead of maximizing their profit. Leaders are expected to serve the people instead of corruptly serving themselves. I call this "integrity of service."

When everyone stands for what's right as a normal way of life -- when that integrity of service is common -- then people can maintain that baseline of mutual respect, even in situations that their past agreements didn't foresee. I believe this explains the Haudenosaunee writer's statement that their "society was founded on concepts of moral justice, not statute law."

When the law and justice are in conflict, which should a culture prioritize? When everyone stands for what's right continuously, they will consistently seek justice instead of mindlessly following their law. "Laws" or "rules" are simply agreements people make to help live in a good way, but in a healthy culture if the law and justice are in conflict, past agreements are never allowed to prevent justice when someone is threatened or attacked.

This explains why deep integrity is so rare in unhealthy cultures. When authorities impose law, and forbid people from upholding the law they live by, they're actually forbidding integrity of service -- the deepest form of integrity. People may still be allowed to have some kinds of integrity, such as speaking the truth, or keeping promises, but in unhealthy cultures people are not allowed to act in service by confronting authorities' injustices. This aspect of integrity is forbidden.

Thus the path to creating a healthy subculture involves holding yourself and others to a high standard of integrity, in secret if you must. Find like-minded people willing to commit to deep spiritual growth, and make agreements for how to relate to each other and the Earth in a respectful way. When you can hold each other to a high standard of integrity so that people consistently uphold the agreements and act in service, you'll be able to relax into that deep trust knowing you're surrounded by trustworthy people.

#### Everything is a Skill, and Everything Can Be Practiced Without Guilt or Shame

Feelings like shame or guilt are some of the biggest obstacles to deep personal growth. People can be very resistant to feedback because they don't want to be unfairly shamed or made to feel guilty by others. Even if the feedback is respectful, people can have subconscious shame or guilt from their childhood that gets triggered, and they can become defensive.

Thus, to really hold yourself and others to a high standard and help people grow when they make a mistake, it is crucial to learn how to have personal growth without shame or guilt.

The first requirement is to have the attitude that, when someone lets you down, they are a _good person making a mistake_, not a bad person being themselves. Trust that they want to show up in a good way and just don't know how -- there's something they're missing, but if they could see it, they would grow and show up well.

Some people are so stuck that they don't grow even with constructive feedback, and you may need to set boundaries and not allow their hurtful behavior in your life anymore. But if someone acts hurtfully and you start with the attitude that they're bad, they will be resistant to any feedback that you offer.

With this attitude of trusting in a person's inherent goodness, it helps me to recognize that everything in life is a skill that can be practiced without guilt or shame.

Think back to a skill you learned as a child. Imagine, for example, that you learned to play soccer. You learned lots of smaller skills such as how to dribble or pass the ball. To get better at passing, what did you do?

You practiced: you tried your best to kick the soccer ball to someone, and sometimes the ball went where you intended and sometimes it didn't. When you kicked the ball in the wrong direction, you figured out what lesson to learn, hopefully without any shame, and then practiced passing the ball with those new lessons in mind. The more you practiced, the more lessons you learned, and the better you got at passing the ball. When you approached all aspects of soccer this way, eventually you became a skilled soccer player.

Qualities like integrity, awareness, gratitude, and generosity are simply skills too, and you can practice them intentionally just like any other skill. Practice approaching life with these qualities, and then notice when you up with them and when you don't. Perhaps sometime you don't have the awareness you want, or you are afraid to tell the truth and so you lie to someone.

Cultivating these qualities is just like learning to kick a soccer ball. When you mess up, avoid any sense of guilt or shame. Just recognize that you made a mistake, and you can learn from it and do better next time. If you hurt or disappointed someone else, acknowledge your mistake, do your best to make it right, learn whatever lessons you can, and commit to doing better. And if you feel any residual fear, guilt, or shame, just let it go.

Deep spiritual growth can be joyful rather than stressful when you approach it without shame and guilt, as part of a group of friends that bring out the best in each other. So long as you're truly committed to that path of spiritual growth, mistakes are simply learning opportunities along the way.

When I really embraced this attitude, my rate of growth increased. In other words, I started learning life lessons faster than before, because I wasn't wasting time feeling shame and guilt. I just noticed my mistakes and learned from them.

#### Build a Healthy Subculture by Building Spiritual Strength Together

It's not easy to learn a new way of life. 









It's crucial to learn life lessons efficiently without guilt and shame, because there are many skills needed to have a healthy culture.

When someone acts dishonestly, what would it take to begin trusting them again? It's crucial to have a _path back to grace_ so people know that if they make a mistake, there're not shunned forever, but there's a way to prove that they've really grown and can be trusted again.

When someone makes a mistake, when is it most helpful to offer unconditional acceptance, and when would it be more helpful to show them their own unmet potential and accept nothing less than excellent behavior?

How can you recognize when someone else is fully giving their sacred gifts and when they're holding back, and when you see they're holding back, how could you help them give themselves fully again?

All these are skills, and all these can be practiced without guilt or shame.

Ultimately, this is a key way to build spiritual strength with others. Hold yourself and others to a high standard of excellent and beautiful behavior. When someone struggles, help them grow without shame or guilt. People commonly rise or fall to the level of expectations set for them. To create a healthy subculture with pervasive trust, hold yourself and others to a high standard as a gift of love.

#### Serve the Earth Together

* Can serve the Earth either by enriching it (ie planting trees, tending the soil) or protecting it from further destruction

* Rev-act: one way or another, as a group, serve the Earth where you live. Cultivate a sense of place and gratitude for the specific gifts all around you.

<div class="rev-act"><div class="rev-act-header">Revolutionary Activity #27<br/>Serve the Earth**</div>
<div class="rev-act-body">Any relationship involves both giving and receiving, so to have a rich relationship with the Earth, it's important to learn to give to it.<br/><br/>
Consider how you would like to serve the nonhumans around you. You could enrich the Earth, such as by planting trees, planting an organic garden where you feed the soil, or removing trash. You could also protect the Earth, such as by slowing or stopping destructive practices such as logging or dumping toxins into rivers. Let your curiosity and interests guide you in choosing how to serve the Earth where you live.</div></div>

### Heal Ancient Traumas Now

Everybody has ancestors that lived in healthy cultures years, decades, centuries, or millennia ago. Those ancestors enjoyed a way of life based on the three core spiritual practices, where every moment and every relationship was meaningful, life was full of joyful gratitude, and people gave their deepest love as a normal way of life without holding back.

At some point, our ancestors suffered something terrible, and eventually the unhealthy culture started to seem "just the way life is."

It is impossible to recreate the past, and there's no "going back." But I believe a profound path of ancient healing comes from building your spiritual strength with others as they build theirs. Cultivate that practical aware gratitude, and give your sacred gifts in reciprocity with others who are giving theirs.

Create the depth of trusting and joyful relationships that once were normal for your ancestors, and could be normal for you now. As you walk this path of cultivating spiritual strength, and find others to walk it with, you'll begin the Deepest Revolution. That path will be beautiful no matter what happens, and it's a necessary part of that larger path leading to new healthy cultures where respect is the norm among the people, and between people and the Earth.
