## Chapter 16: The Deepest Revolution, Part 2: Build Healthy Subcultures by Building Spiritual Strength with Others

Can you imagine what life would be like if you deeply trusted everyone around you to stand for what's right and take care of each other no matter what?

Okanagan woman Jeannette Armstrong described this deep trust vividly when she said, "The realization that people and community are there to sustain you creates the most secure feeling in the world."[xxx-original instructions|armstrong]

In order to have this deep trust, people of healthy cultures consistently hold each other to high standards of excellent and beautiful behavior. In other words, they have high expectations or standards for each other for qualities like integrity, generosity, awareness, authenticity, physical resilience, joyfulness, personal growth, walking a meaningful path, and bravery.

When qualities like deep integrity and generosity become widespread, it's easy to see how trust becomes widespread too.

A key aspect of creating a new healthy culture is remembering or learning how to hold yourself and others to a high standard. Plenty of stories from healthy cultures show just how high our standards could be for each other.

_Integrity:_ In every legal system around the world, people are required to testify under oath, and they are threatened with severe punishment for lying. The assumption is that participants might lie if they weren't threatened with severe punishment.

In contrast, integrity was so pervasive among the traditional Apache that they did not compel anyone to take an oath because, according to Geronimo, "it is not believed that they will give false testimony in a matter relating to their own people."[xxx-geronimo autobio|Unwritten Laws of the Apaches]

Can you imagine if there was no need for an oath to tell the truth, because people in your group already expected total honesty from each other as a normal way of life?

_Physical resilience:_: Crow woman Pretty Shield described how physically resilient her people were when they lived in a traditional way. She said, "Ahh, my people were tough in those days... [W]hen I was young, if in winter a person fell into icy water, he got out, took off his wet clothes, and rolled in the snow, rubbing his body with it, and got warm. Then, after squeezing out the water, he put on his clothes and forgot about getting wet. Now my people wear gloves, and too many clothes. We are soft as mud."[xxx-red mother|p84]

Can you imagine if the people around you were so physically resilient that even being soaking wet in winter was nothing to worry about, but just a little trouble to fix?

_Generosity:_ A Christian missionary once visited men of the Ojibway, Cheyenne, Cree and Sioux nations, and he described Jesus Christ's selfless generosity. Christ gave away all his possessions and urged others to do the same while dedicating his life to feeding, healing, and protecting his people. The missionary was told that, prior to colonization, Jesus Christ's level of selfless generosity was simply normal among them.[xxx-from deep woods to civilization|civ preached practiced]

Can you imagine living in a nation where someone like Jesus Christ was considered admirable but not remarkable because such selfless generosity is simply normal and expected?

_Meaningful Education for Young People:_ One Nootka storyteller described how the women would often have their moon time at the same time each month, and they would go to a special house and enjoy a four-day party. They would sit on special soft moss and give their blood back to the Earth and play games and talk. Women would rub each others' back and make special tea if someone had cramps. This became a major opportunity for older women to mentor younger women. For example, young women learned the special Frog posture that could help relieve cramps and make childbirth easier.

Could you imagine if adults took young people's education seriously, offering them the most meaningful mentorship they could every day?

_Benefitting the Earth:_ Stories abound of people of healthy cultures actually benefitting the Earth as a normal way of life rather than depleting it. Robin Kimmerer described how Black Ash trees actually became _more abundant_ in regions where it was respectfully harvested by Mohawk and Potawatomi basket makers, and this remains true today.[xxx-braiding sweetgrass|wisgaak gokpenagen] Apache man Stalking Wolf described how he respectfully harvested a sapling to make a bow in such a way that the overall forest benefitted, and the chosen tree yielded a powerful bow.[xxx-the vision|p80]

Can you imagine if your normal way of life benefitted the Earth around you, increasing the natural abundance that you depended on?

When people really bring out the best in each other, have high expectations, or hold each other to a high standard, we humans really are capable of maintaining that baseline of mutual respect among each other, and between people and the Earth.

In a sense, members of nations such as the Potawatomi, Apache, and Nootka are people like anyone else. They have attitudes, skills and awareness that anybody could cultivate -- including you and the people around you.

You could hold yourself and others to a high standard of integrity. You and the people around you could cultivate physical resilience, mentor young people in a good way, and learn how to receive the Earth's gifts in a way that actually benefits the Earth.

This is the path to building a culture of deep trust. Have high expectations for yourself and the people around you so that qualities like integrity, bravery, awareness, and generosity are simply normal and expected.

<div class="rev-act-body">Think of a time when someone had faith in you, maybe even more faith than you had in yourself. Did someone help you find the self-respect to leave an abusive romantic relationship? Did a coach help you cultivate the discipline to train at your sport and be the best you could be? Did a teacher help you realize you could be great at whatever you put your mind to? If this mentor did their job properly, they did not shame or punish you, but helped you see your unmet potential and urged you to reach it -- to be your best self, and not settle for less. Think of an example like this where someone really brought out the best in you, holding you to a high standard.<br/><br/>Watch for an instance where someone lets themselves or others down. Perhaps they lie to someone or to themselves, or give up on a big goal too easily, or tolerate an unsatisfying relationship or job without even trying to change it. One way or another, help them find the strength to show up better.</div></div>

<div class="rev-act-body">Oftentimes, when one person feels upset by another, they'll express themselves but not communicate very clearly or very respectfully. Whenever someone expresses anger or frustration with you, or offers you constructive feedback, actively look for the lesson to learn so that you can grow from the experience. Repeat the lesson back to them, to ensure both you and the other person agree on it. This ensures you heard them properly, and that you only learn lessons that you agree with. Do what you can to make it easy rather than difficult for others to give you constructive feedback if they see you making a mistake.</div></div>

#### When People Develop Low Standards

One consequence of being conquered is that people may be tempted to accept their own submissive obedience as legitimate and normal. When this happens, _people's standards for themselves and each other drop a lot._ In other words, when a person or group finally tolerates their own obedient submission, they stop expecting very much of themselves or others. People don't really expect life to be deeply meaningful, or don't trust other people, or learn to focus mostly on themselves or pleasing others instead of standing for what's right. People may engage in superficial or wishful thinking, and even adopt the ideologies of their abusers.

The underlying attitudes are things like, "Why go to the trouble of cultivating integrity and bravery if my comfortable life doesn't demand these qualities?" or "Why confront injustice if I don't trust others to stand with me, and if it wouldn't do any good anyway?" or "I don't trust anyone and need to look after myself."

Widespread low standards or low expectations have many tragic consequences for both men and women.

A core masculine gift is that of setting boundaries, especially protecting one's people from threats. In all cultures, few things inspire men more than the need to protect their people from danger. And yet, in unhealthy cultures, the rulers are the greatest threat to the people. The greatest threat is not from outside; it is within the culture itself.

As a result, abusive cultures raise boys not to honor their innate spiritual calling to protect their people from threats as a gift of love, without any compensation or orders. Instead, men commonly grow up learning to tolerate, ignore, or perpetuate abuse.

When boys are raised to deny or twist this deep love-gift of boundary-setting and protection, unhealthy cultures wind up with deeply spiritually confused men who ask questions like "When does life become meaningful?" or "Why am I even here?"

This ultimately is the spiritual reality behind Henry David Thoreau's comment that "The mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation."[xxx-walden] It also explains the famous statement that "Every man dies. Not every man really lives."[xxx-braveheart every man] Living a life where a person has learned to hold back their love and not stand for what's right is deeply unsatisfying.

This also explains why women in unhealthy cultures around the world keep asking, "Where are all the good men?" Whether in feminist literature from the Americas, Europe, or Asia, this is a common question going back to the dawn of unhealthy cultures.[xxx-odoc|ch47]

Of course, women can set boundaries and protect their people too. And yet, when this protective boundary-setting is forbidden in unhealthy cultures, a core masculine gift is rejected and many men become spiritually lost.

People endlessly debate the meaning of "toxic masculinity," and this perspective gets to the heart of the trouble: unhealthy cultures do not train boys to be good men, because good men stand for what's right and protect their people from any threat, and authorities forbid this. Boys learn to cope with this deep trouble in a variety of ways. Some become selfish or become people pleasers, or distract themselves from their meaningless life with things like alcohol, drugs, superficial hobbies, or overwork.

Every transition into unhealthy cultures requires deep spiritual wounding where people are expected to hold back their love and not protect their people from the biggest threats. Sioux man Rain-In-The-Face described it vividly, saying his "spirit was gone then; only his poor body lived on..." He could at least recognize his spiritual wound because he had grown up in a culture that welcomed his deepest love. He knew what giving his love and setting protective boundaries was like, so he knew something was wrong when these gifts were unwelcome in the American unhealthy culture.[xxx-indian heroes and great chieftains|rain-in-the-face]

Most boys in unhealthy cultures never learn what it's like to give their deepest love because they're trained for obedience instead of standing for what's right. Training children for obedience actually trains them for cowardice, as they learn to take the comfortable and safe path (ie doing what they're told to stay out of trouble) instead of bravely standing for what's right.

When children are trained for obedience, is it any wonder that cowardice is common in adulthood, and people have low trust in each other?

When boys are trained for cowardly obedience instead of bravely protecting their people from any threat or abuse, is it any surprise that so many women wonder where all the good men are? And when so many men are lost, is it any surprise that most men don't know what the women are talking about?

For years, I didn't understand this question myself -- what do you mean where are all the good men? I didn't know what a good man was until I studied healthy cultures where boys are consistenty raised to be good men who stand for what's right and bravely protect their people from any threat. Stories of profoundly trustworthy men and trusting women from the Crow, Cheyenne, and Lakota showed me that all the men of a nation can be trustworthy.[xxx-odoc|ch47]

Of course, women can become spiritually lost too, such as those who believe women can be "liberated" by becoming well-paid wage slaves, selfish executives and corrupt politicians, just like spiritually lost men.

Instead of seeking real freedom, authorities in unhealthy cultures trick everyone into thinking that "freedom" just means being able to do whatever you want without financial or cultural restraint, and so the way to be free is to get rich. But this is the faux-freedom of kings who don't have to care about anyone else or follow any laws.

Real freedom comes when everyone stands for what's right as a normal way of life, so that everyone can enjoy justice and deep respect from their neighbors. When people forget this and just look after themselves, it's easy to become spiritually lost and let selfishness take over.

I certainly do _not_ suggest anyone quit their job. Just realize that individuals getting better-paid jobs is not the path to collective freedom. 

Revolutionaries like the Black Panthers and Zapatistas often kept working their jobs to support themselves as they sought to free their people. Black Panther Don Cox put it well: "use what you got to get what you need." Making money and getting rich shouldn't be the end-goal. Just like the Tzutujil Mayans and Huron who liked to get rich so they could give it all away, or Harriet Tubman who saved up money so she could return South to help others escape chattel slavery, I support people in making money so they can do the most good in service of the people and nonhumans they love.

When you know what to look for, you will see how low our expectations are for each other in unhealthy cultures. But it doesn't need to be this way. To create healthy subcultures and eventually sovereign healthy cultures, we need to raise our standards!

<div class="rev-act-body">One of the biggest causes of self-centeredness is the belief that a person is on their own, and can't trust others to come to their aid in times of need. Think of a friend or family member that you care about, and with whom you already have a mutually nourishing relationship.  and whom you would definitely help in moments of need -- whether they get sick, get in a car accident, get arrested, or lose their job. Find a private moment or invite them to a private conversation, look them in the eye, and tell them you care about them and would support them in moments of need.</div></div>

#### Everything is a Skill, and Everything Can Be Practiced Without Guilt or Shame

Feelings like shame or guilt are some of the biggest obstacles to deep personal growth. They can also make a person resistant to receiving feedback from others, making it difficult for people to hold each other to high standards of behavior. People can resist feedback because they don't want to be unfairly shamed or made to feel guilty. Even if the feedback is respectful, people can have subconscious shame or guilt from their childhood that gets triggered, and they can become defensive.

Thus, to really hold yourself and others to a high standard and help people grow when they make a mistake, it is crucial to learn how to have personal growth without shame or guilt.

The first requirement is to have the attitude that, when someone lets you down, they are a _good person making a mistake_, not a bad person being themselves. Trust that they want to show up in a good way and just don't know how -- there's something they're missing, but if they could see it, they would grow and show up well.

Some people are so stuck that they don't grow even with constructive feedback, and you may need to set boundaries and not allow their hurtful behavior in your life anymore. But if someone acts hurtfully and you start with the attitude that they're bad, they will be resistant to any feedback that you offer.

With this attitude of trusting in a person's inherent goodness, it helps me to recognize that everything in life is a skill that can be practiced without guilt or shame.

Think back to a skill you learned as a child. Imagine, for example, that you learned to play soccer. You learned lots of smaller skills such as how to dribble or pass the ball. To get better at passing, what did you do?

You practiced: you tried your best to kick the soccer ball to someone, and sometimes the ball went where you intended and sometimes it didn't. When you kicked the ball in the wrong direction, you figured out what lesson to learn, hopefully without any shame, and then practiced passing the ball with those new lessons in mind. The more you practiced, the more lessons you learned, and the more proper technique became normal and engrained. If you approached all aspects of soccer this way, eventually you became a skilled soccer player.

Qualities like integrity, awareness, gratitude, and generosity are simply skills too, and you can practice them intentionally just like any other skill. Practice approaching life with these qualities, and then notice when you up with them and when you don't. Perhaps sometimes you don't have the awareness you want, or you are afraid to tell the truth and so you lie instead.

Cultivating these qualities is just like learning to kick a soccer ball. When you mess up, avoid any sense of guilt or shame. Just recognize that you made a mistake, and you can learn from it and do better next time. If you hurt or disappointed someone else, acknowledge your mistake, do your best to make it right, learn whatever lessons you can, and commit to doing better. And if you feel any residual fear, guilt, or shame, just let it go.

And just like you practice kicking a soccer ball before the game, you can practice these beautiful qualities outside the normal flow of life. Take bravery for example, which is simply the ability to remain conscious and do what you know in your heart is right even if you feel uncomfortable or afraid. To practice bravery, you intentionally put yourself in uncomfortable or scary situations and practice maintaining your composure. If you're scared of dancing, go dancing. If cold water feels uncomfortable, practice being in cold water. Learn to feel _comfortable in the midst of discomfort_ so that nothing causes you to ever "hold back" or "shut down" parts of yourself.

The book _One Disease One Cure_ contains many more suggestions for cultivating bravery, integrity, and other qualities.[xxx-odoc]

Spiritual growth can be joyful rather than stressful when you approach it without shame and guilt, as part of a group of friends that bring out the best in each other. So long as you're truly committed to that path of spiritual growth, mistakes are simply learning opportunities along the way.

When I really embraced this attitude, my rate of growth increased. In other words, I started learning life lessons faster than before, because I wasn't wasting time feeling shame and guilt. I just noticed my mistakes, learned from them, and moved on.

<div class="rev-act"><div class="rev-act-header">Revolutionary Activity #29<br/>Practice bravery</div>
<div class="rev-act-body">Think of a fear that you're avoiding right now. You may have lied to someone and you're afraid of owning up to it, or you're afraid of quitting an unsatisfying job or asking an attractive person on a date. Face your fear, recognize that you can handle whatever comes, and do the thing you're afraid to do.</div></div>

#### Build a Healthy Subculture by Building Spiritual Strength Together

If you've completed the revolutionary activities so far, you're well on your way to building a healthy subculture with others. You've practiced standing for what's right and supporting others when they take a stand. You've practiced giving generously and receiving graciously. You've practiced cultivating gratitude, giving your sacred gifts, and forming relationships of reciprocity where people share with each other over time.

You've practiced receiving the Earth's gifts with gratitude, and giving back to the Earth. You've questioned your assumptions, practiced bravery, and channeled your anger in productive ways.

You've joined with other people into groups that continually share with each other, and where people can safely speak their heart. You've practiced holding others to high standards, and making it easy for others to do the same for you.

Ultimately, I believe the path to building healthy subcultures is to find others who also want this beautiful way of life, and practice the revolutionary activities together. Practice supporting each other, sharing, standing for what's right, holding each other to a high standard, encouraging each person to give their sacred gifts, and cultivating bravery.

Build up each other's dignity, and help each other remember what's important in life -- taking care of each other and the Earth.

Ultimately, you'll be building spiritual strength together with other people, with each person bringing out the best in everyone else. If you can do this, you'll actually be creating your own law -- that is, your own standards of appropriate behavior based on justice and mutual aid, not punitive rules.

The Haudenosaunee writers described how their "society was founded on concepts of moral justice, not statute law."[xxx-a basic call to consciousness|p38] Such a society can only exist when everyone has that spiritual strength to stand for what's right. And building new groups and networks of groups where people cultivate that spiritual strength is the path to building new healthy subcultures.

For as long as these groups are trapped in unhealthy cultures, they will be healthy subcultures where people stand for each other and for the Earth, while living under unhealthy-culture laws. When an opportunity arises for that Deepest Revolution, like the Zapatistas in 1994 after 10 years' preparation, healthy subcultures will have the cohesion and vision to take a full stand and finally free themselves to become fully sovereign healthy nations.

<div class="rev-act-body">People have unity when they all deeply care about the same things. This is part of the magic of the Haudenosaunee's Thanksgiving Address -- among other things, it's a public statement where they remind themselves of their shared gratitude for the Earth, and how important it is to them.<br/><br/>Build unity with others by caring for the Earth together. Whether you're protecting a forest or river from destruction or pollution, or enriching the soil or creating new bird habitat, find a practical way with others to give back to the nonhumans who give us humans so much.</div></div>

#### Building a Healthy Culture is Hard -- But We Are Healthy Cultures

Building a healthy culture with others is challenging. We have a way of life that encourages things like superficiality, ineffective political movements, division, deceit, and selfishness. A lot of people learn to feel helpless or not care about anything, as their society seems so sick and there's no clear, legal path of deep change.

It would already be hard to grow up surrounded by these hurtful qualities and then embrace a way of life based on integrity, generosity, and deep connection instead. It becomes immensely harder when authorities sabotage solidarity, train people for obedience, spread lies, murder spiritual leaders, abuse children, and keep people in poverty.

The only way to change this is to form new subcultures with real solidarity despite all the challenges, where it's safe to give generously and stand for what's right, knowing each person has the others' backs no matter what. Where people stand for the needs of the nonhumans to ensure the Earth remains a healthy place for all its inhabitants.

Despite the centuries of oppression, the truth remains: Being treated with care and respect, feeding others and being fed, meeting life's needs with meaningful work, and living closely with open-hearted people feels wonderful. And it feels so incredibly wonderful because this is who we really are.

We are healthy cultures; each one of us has the same urges towards gratitude, integrity, sharing, and all the other beautiful qualities explored in this book, even if some people have learned to ignore those urges to survive in their unhealthy culture. Every one of us has deep love to give. Every one of us can embrace and live these qualities at any time, generating healthy subcultures everywhere we go.

So spread the good news. Healthy cultures exist, and for those of us trapped in unhealthy cultures, it doesn't need to be this way. Cultivate your spiritual strength, and build deep relationships with other people and the Earth. Perhaps you will someday be part of a nation that lives in freedom, or perhaps you will lay the groundwork so that a future generation can.

As countless spiritual leaders like Tubman, Christ, and King show, giving your sacred gifts may not always be a comfortable path. Authorities might even make it dangerous. But at least it will be a path worth walking.
