## Chapter 15: The Deepest Revolution, Pt 1: Cultivate Your Spiritual Strength

### Find the Courage to Release What Isn't Working

So many aspects of our way of life in unhealthy cultures keep us stuck. Your profit economy encourages you to focus on your own needs and make money just to survive. We are conditioned in countless ways about what to care about and what to ignore, and where to put our attention, time, and money. And so often in unhealthy cultures, many "conventional" or "mainstream" values are somehow superficial or misguided.

Growing up, I learned that the United States was the best country in the world, and I felt proud to live in a capitalist democracy. I looked forward to contributing to the United States' progress in many ways throughout my life. As a church-going Christian, I bowed my head every night before dinner and prayed.

Over time, as I learned all the things that I share in this book, I had to give up a lot of beliefs -- beliefs about the society I live in, beliefs about history, beliefs about myself, beliefs about the future, beliefs about what matters and what doesn't matter.

Giving up old beliefs and perspectives is hard, even when it's obvious that they don't work. Don Cox described his own transformation. He had engaged in various kinds of activism to fight racial oppression in the US, but finally in 1967 he went to a conference where black people openly discussed oppression and revolution. Cox heard Black Panthers speak for the first time. He said, "I was drunk with this new world I had not even known existed. Pieces started falling into place. It was a cascade, a snowball rolling down the mountainside."[xxx-just another nigger|just another nigger]

Then he described how hard this was: "Everything I had heard during the weekend helped me understand that all the efforts I had made up until then to be acceptable to mainstream society had just made me a 'good nigger.' I was simultaneously ashamed and furious. All I could do was cry." Cox eventually dedicated himself to freeing black Americans from oppression, becoming a senior leader in the Black Panthers.

Bogaletch Gebre described her own powerful transformation. As a young adult, she underwent female genitual mutilation in Ethiopia, being taught that it made her a "whole woman." Later in life, a friend learned of this and felt horrified, and at first Gebre defended the practice as she had for years. Then she had her own transformation, as she "experienced an incredible awakening, then a tidal wave of anger, as I began to comprehend all that had been taken from me in ignorance. Tears of understanding flooded from me as I allowed the scientist in me to see, to examine in a new light, all that I remembered..." Gebre went on to lead a movement to abolish female genital mutilation.[xxx-original instructions|ethiopian women]

Giving up old beliefs can be hard. Even Jesus Christ needed 40 days alone in the desert before he could fully confront the urge to seek wealth and power which his unhealthy culture tempted him with, and instead choose a path of service. After his transformation, he began his ministry which has inspired people for 2,000 years.

This kind of transformation seems common among activists and spiritual leaders. When you grow up in an unhealthy culture, you may be taught all kinds of hurtful or wrong things -- perhaps you learned that obedience is good and people are basically bad or selfish (addressed in Chapter 9), selfishness is normal and good (Chapter 7), some people are worse than others or deserve to suffer (Chapter 10), political and religious authorities serve the people (Chapter 8, 12 and 13), or that you live in a free society (Chapter 6).

But in order for Don Cox, Jesus Christ, and Bogaletch Gebre to truly serve their people, they had to go through those transformations where they released the beliefs and attitudes that weren't working.

It becomes so much easier to give up old beliefs when you see a better way. It's easier to give up on authoritarian democracy or divinely-ordained monarchy when you see how actually-free people choose their leaders. It's easier to give up submissive obedience when you see how people live without it. It's easier to trust people when you know how trustworthy people can be.

Embrace your curiosity, and open your mind to possibilities that maybe didn't seem possible before. As you free your mind from beliefs that don't work, you'll make space for perspectives that do, and which empower you to make a difference for the people and nonhumans around you.

### Giving a Shit: the Heart of Spiritual Strength





When I really study the great spiritual leaders I've found, something really stands out: it's like they don't feel like they have any choice in matter; they're compelled to serve their people.

Harriet Tubman was a black runaway slave during the times of US chattel slavery. And when she finally reached the North, where chattel slavery was outlawed, her first thought was to return to her people and free them too.

In the coming years, she kept going back to free people, over and over. She was never caught, but if she had been, she'd have been tortured with unthinkable cruelty. But she loved her people so much, the risk was worth it to her.

Jesus Christ and Martin Luther King Jr were the same -- both of them repeatedly acknowledged that they were going to die because of the ways they served their people, and yet they kept on serving in the deepest ways they knew how.




I think of spiritual strength as giving your deepest love and standing for what's right in any moment.

It may sound abstract or aspirational, but really it's just what people expect of each other.









A person with spiritual strength gives their deepest love and stands for what's right in each moment.

Writing about "spiritual strength" can make it seem abstract or unattainable, but it's actually just what people expect of each other.

Part of cultivating that spiritual strength involves cultivating deep relationships with other people and the Earth so that you care enough to serve them.

Do you have relationships with other people whom you trust, who you feel so grateful for that you actively look for ways to give back to them? Do you have any relationships with nonhumans like this, where you feel so grateful for them that you actively look for ways to serve them back?

This depth of relationship with nonhumans is actually common even in unhealthy cultures. Many people feel grateful for the unconditional joyful affection of their pet dogs or cats, and look for ways to give back to them. I've met a number of people who trust their dog or cat more than they trust other humans.

If you don't have a deep connection with other people, or a deep connection with Earth, 




### Can You Imagine Deeply Trusting the People Around You?

What is the biggest difference between a present-day Haudenosaunee, Cherokee, or another healthy-culture person who carries on their traditions, and your average American, Russian, or German?

All of them live under ruling-class laws, so none of them are free. Any of them can get a job or start families. What is the difference?

I believe the key difference is this: people of healthy cultures, even when recently forced to live under ruling-class laws, _remember what it is like when everyone in a nation has spiritual strength._ They remember how to live with integrity and bravery, how to cultivate deep awareness, and how to live in a way that enriches the Earth instead of trashing it. They remember how to cultivate that practical, aware gratitude, help each other give their sacred gifts, and live in reciprocity with each other and the Earth.

In other words, people of healthy cultures remember how to live where people have high standards for each other, or high expectations. In traditional times, people did not just expect each other to be pretty honest, but totally honest. People did not expect occasional generosity, but continual generosity. Even if many healthy cultures cannot fully live in a traditional way today, they carry that cultural memory that a beautiful way of life is possible, and many people live those ancient values as much as they can.

For the average American, Russian, or German, sometime in the past our ancestors stopped passing down those stories, so most of us don't carry that cultural memory of how to live in a good way, where people have high expectations of each other, and hold each other to a high standard of excellent and beautiful behavior.

Stories from healthy cultures show just how high our standards could be for each other.

#### A High Standard of Integrity

In every unhealthy-culture court system around the world, people are required to testify under oath, and they are threatened with severe punishment for lying. The assumption is that if participants weren't threatened with severe punishments, they might not tell the whole truth.

In contrast, integrity was so pervasive among the traditional Apache that they did not compel anyone to take such an oath. Apache man Geronimo told his biographer that, if a dispute escalated to a level that required community support to resolve, the chief would bring together the relevant people and witnesses to understand the issue and come to a decision. However, Geronimo said that "witnesses are not placed under oath, because it is not believed that they will give false testimony in a matter relating to their own people."[xxx-geronimo autobio|Unwritten Laws of the Apaches]

Can you imagine if there was no need for an oath to tell the truth, because people in your group already expected total honesty from each other as a normal way of life?

#### A High Standard of Physical Resilience

Crow woman Pretty Shield described how physically resilient her people were when they lived in a traditional way. She said, "Ahh, my people were tough in those days... [W]hen I was young, if in winter a person fell into icy water, he got out, took off his wet clothes, and rolled in the snow, rubbing his body with it, and got warm. Then, after squeezing out the water, he put on his clothes and forgot about getting wet. Now my people wear gloves, and too many clothes. We are soft as mud."[xxx-red mother|p84]

Can you imagine if the people around you were so physically resilient that even being soaking wet in winter was nothing to worry about, but just a little trouble to fix?

#### A High Standard of Generosity and Service

(Jesus Christ just seemed normal to people of healthy cultures)

Can you imagine if a missionary came to you with stories of an amazing man who gave away everything he had and dedicated his life to feeding the hungry, healing the sick, confronting injustice, and if your reponse was "Yeah, that's just how my people are. Jesus Christ sounds like just a normal good man."

#### A High Standard of Meaningful Education for Young People

One Nootka storyteller described how the women would often have their moon time at the same time each month, and they would go to a special house and enjoy a four-day party. They would sit on special soft moss and give their blood back to the Earth and play games and talk. Women would rub each others' back and make special tea if someone had cramps. This became a major opportunity for older women to mentor younger women. For example, young women learned the special Frog posture that could help relieve cramps and make childbirth easier.

Could you imagine if adults took young people's education seriously, offering them the most meaningful education and mentorship they could?

#### A High Standard of Benefitting the Earth

Stories abound of people of healthy cultures actually _benefitting_ the Earth as a normal way of life rather than depleting it. Robin Kimmerer described how traditional Potawatomi and Mohawk basket makers would respectfully harvest Black Ash trees to make their baskets, and Black Ash actually became _more abundant_ in regions where it was respectfully harvested, and this remains true today.[xxx-braiding sweetgrass|wisgaak gokpenagen] Apache man Stalking Wolf described in detail how he respectfully harvested a sapling to make a bow in such a way that the overall forest benefitted, and the chosen tree yielded a powerful bow.[xxx-the vision|p80]

Can you imagine if your normal way of life benefitted the Earth around you, increasing the natural abundance that you depended on?

When people really bring out the best in each other, have high expectations, or hold each other to a high standard, we humans really are capable of maintaining that baseline of mutual respect among each other, and between people and the Earth.

In a sense, the Potawatomi, Apache, Nootka, and Crow are people like anyone else. They have attitudes, skills and awareness that anybody could cultivate -- including you and the people around you.

You could hold yourself and the people around you to a high standard of integrity. You and the people around you could cultivate physical resilience, mentor young people in a good way, and learn how to receive the Earth's gifts in a way that actually benefits the Earth.

<div class="rev-act"><div class="rev-act-header">Revolutionary Activity #18<br/>Remember when you were held to a high standard</div>
<div class="rev-act-body">Think of a time when someone had faith in you, maybe even more faith than you had in yourself. Did someone help you find the self-respect to leave an abusive romantic relationship? Did a coach help you cultivate the discipline to train at your sport and be the best you could be? Did a teacher help you realize you could be great at whatever you put your mind to? Think of an example like this where someone really brought out the best in you, holding you to a high standard.<br/><br/>Now imagine being part of a group where everybody supported each other this way continually, in all areas of life. No one imposes their ideology on you, but they hold you to a high standard of excellent and beautiful behavior in your job, family life, social groups, and activism work, bringing out the best in you every day. And imagine you get to support others in the same way. How would that feel?</div></div>

### When People are discouraged from developing high standards and are rewarded for low standards, the outcome is dismal

Once people are conquered, and they accept being ruled in their unhealthy culture as normal and legitimate, _people's standards for themselves and each other drops a lot._ In other words, when a person or group finally considers it legitimate and ok to submit to authorities, they stop expecting very much of themselves or each other. People don't really expect life to be deeply meaningful, don't deeply trust others, or learn to focus mostly on themselves or pleasing others to keep life comfortable.

The underlying attitudes are things like, "Why bother cultivating deep integrity and bravery if I just want to keep my comfortable, predictable life and not rock the boat?" or "Why confront injustice if I don't trust others to stand with me, and if it wouldn't do any good anyway?"

As Part 2 showed, unhealthy cultures reward and encourage all our worst qualities, such as selfishness, cowardice, disconnection from each other and the Earth, ignorance, and superficiality. When people stop standing for what's right, and instead focus on keeping their job or wealth while staying out of trouble, these qualities can become widespread.

If a group of people wanted to form the seed of a new healthy culture, what would they need to do? In other words, what is a crucial early step on the path to the Deepest Revolution?

I believe one thing is crucial: _Hold yourself and others to the highest standards of excellent and beautiful behavior._

It takes deep spiritual strength to consistently hold yourself and others to such high standards. Fortunately, if you've been completing the revolutionary activities, you're already on the path of growing your spiritual strength.

### How to Cultivate Your Spiritual Strength, Regardless Your Unhealthy Culture




* connect with the Earth, with real gratitude and real ways of serving it

* connect with other people, where you feel real gratitude for them and find real ways of serving them.

* in other words, connect with people and nonhumans and form relationships where you really care about them -- where their wellbeing and aspirations matter to you.

Many parents spend vast amounts of time and energy on their children. They care about their children and find many ways of serving them -- helping them with schoolwork, mentoring, supporting them in playing sports or studying music. This comes from a place of deep caring.

Imagine caring just as much about people around you that you aren't related to, or caring just as much about the local population of deer, or a nearby river.

This is actually the normal depth of caring in healthy cultures, where people see divinity in every creature, and feel grateful for each creature's gifts. That's why Jenu Kuruba shaman JK Thimma said "who do you think will take care of the forest better? Us, who worship the animals, or you, who see the animals as wild and are frightened of them?"

Many adults lack deep connections with others where they can feel deeply invested and meaningfully act in service, and often their children become the only outlet for this attitude of service.

Parenting is one aspect of life where people can strongly influence someone else's life path (their kids') both for better or worse. But I believe in healthy cultures, adults feel as invested in each other as many parents do in their kids.     

Imagine being surrounded by people and nonhumans you cared about, and who cared about you, and you were really invested in their wellbeing. I think this is the normal way of life in a healthy culture.

The tragedy of unhealthy cultures is that, when they conquer healthy cultures, they do their best to destroy these deeply caring relationships between the people, and between the people and the Earth. Whether by forcing people out of the region entirely, as with the Cherokee Trail of Tears or Potawatomi Trail of Death, or imposing land ownership and then making land too expensive for most to own, or a thousand other ways, unhealthy cultures make it hard for people to form deep connections with the Earth.

And with all the divisiveness, the racism and sexism, the lazy thinking and foolish assumptions, the police that oppress solidarity movements and attack our spiritual leaders, and economies that reward selfishness, they make it hard for people to connect in ways where each person is deeply grateful for the other.

Is it any wonder attitudes of despair and hopelessness are so common? I actually believe these attitudes are widespread and people simply learn to ignore them.

When the Gumbaynggirr people in Australia worked to protect local forests from logging, even many locals who liked the idea didn't help much, with one saying, "

But ultimately, that depth of caring and connection with others is the source of spiritual strength. You have sacred gifts, but if you only serve yourself, why bother giving everything you have? But if you served others -- then your gifts start to really _matter_, and it matters how you show up in life.

Why did Jesus Christ keep serving his people even when he knew he would be killed for it? Why did Martin Luther King Jr keep serving his people even though he knew he would be killed for it? Ultimately, it's because they cared. 




* Have ever been around someone that you knew had potential, but they were holding back somehow? Maybe out of depression, or low self-worth, or self-centeredness. Whatever the reason, they were holding back. How did YOU feel noticing them hold back? Did it hurt? Did you feel upset noticing how much good this other person could do in the world, or how much joy they could be having, and instead they were tolerating depression, or a meaningless job, or an abusive or mediocre romantic relationship? 




The three core spiritual practices really are essential. If you don't care about other people or nonhumans, you'll never be motivated to...; You matter, and how you show up in life matters -- you have sacred gifts to give. But to whom will you give your gifts? To what cause, what people, what nonhumans? Why, the ones you love -- the ones you feel so grateful for that it would hurt not to serve them however you could.

And when you're giving your gifts from a place of gratitude for the people and nonhumans around you -- then you'll be living in reciprocity, where each person serves the wellbeing of the others, and collectively everyone benefits.
