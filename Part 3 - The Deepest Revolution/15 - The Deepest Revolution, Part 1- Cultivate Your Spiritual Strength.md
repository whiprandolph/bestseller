## Chapter 15: The Deepest Revolution, Part 1: Cultivate Your Spiritual Strength

What is the biggest difference between a present-day Haudenosaunee, Cherokee, or another healthy-culture person who carries on their traditions, and your average American, Russian, or German?

All of them live under ruling-class laws, so none of them are free. Any of them can get a job or start families. What is the difference?

I believe the key difference is this: people of healthy cultures, even when recently forced to live under ruling-class laws, _remember what it is like when everyone in a nation has spiritual strength._ They remember how to live with integrity and bravery, how to cultivate deep awareness, and how to live in a way that enriches the Earth instead of trashing it. They remember how to cultivate that practical, aware gratitude, help each other give their sacred gifts, and live in reciprocity with each other and the Earth.

In other words, people of healthy cultures remember how to live where people have high standards for each other, or high expectations. In traditional times, people did not just expect each other to be pretty honest, but totally honest. People did not expect occasional generosity, but continual generosity. Even if many healthy cultures cannot fully live in a traditional way today, they carry that cultural memory that a beautiful way of life is possible, and many people live it as much as they can.

For the average American, Russian, or German, sometime in the past our ancestors stopped passing down those stories, so most of us don't remember how to live in a good way, where people have high expectations of each other, and hold each other to a high standard of excellent and beautiful behavior.

Can you imagine being around people of complete integrity? Impressive physical resilience? Who take their kids' education seriously? People who love the Earth dearly, and feel its love in return?

Stories from healthy cultures show just how high our standards could be for each other.

### How High Can Our Standards Be?

_Integrity:_ In every unhealthy-culture court system around the world, people are required to testify under oath, and they are threatened with severe punishment for lying. The assumption is that if participants weren't threatened with severe punishments, they might not tell the whole truth.

In contrast, integrity was so pervasive among the traditional Apache that they did not compel anyone to take such an oath. Apache man Geronimo told his biographer that, if a dispute escalated to a level that required community support to resolve, the chief would bring together the relevant people and witnesses to understand the issue and come to a decision. However, Geronimo said that "witnesses are not placed under oath, because it is not believed that they will give false testimony in a matter relating to their own people."[xxx-geronimo autobio|Unwritten Laws of the Apaches]

Can you imagine if there was no need for an oath to tell the truth, because people in your group already expected total honesty from each other as a normal way of life?

_Physical resilience:_ Crow woman Pretty Shield described how physically resilient her people were when they lived in a traditional way. She said, "Ahh, my people were tough in those days... [W]hen I was young, if in winter a person fell into icy water, he got out, took off his wet clothes, and rolled in the snow, rubbing his body with it, and got warm. Then, after squeezing out the water, he put on his clothes and forgot about getting wet. Now my people wear gloves, and too many clothes. We are soft as mud."[xxx-red mother|p84]

Can you imagine if the people around you were so physically resilient that even being soaking wet in winter was nothing to worry about, but just a little trouble to fix?

_Meaningful education for young people:_ One Nootka storyteller described how the women would often have their moon time at the same time each month, and they would go to a special house and enjoy a four-day party. They would sit on special soft moss and give their blood back to the Earth and play games and talk. Women would rub each others' back and make special tea if someone had cramps. This became a major opportunity for older women to mentor younger women. For example, young women learned the special Frog posture that could help relieve cramps and make childbirth easier.

Could you imagine if adults took young people's education seriously, offering them the most meaningful education and mentorship they could?

_Benefitting the Earth:_ Stories abound of people of healthy cultures actually _benefitting_ the Earth as a normal way of life rather than depleting it. Robin Kimmerer described how traditional Potawatomi and Mohawk basket makers would respectfully harvest Black Ash trees to make their baskets, and Black Ash actually became _more abundant_ in regions where it was respectfully harvested, and this remains true today.[xxx-braiding sweetgrass|wisgaak gokpenagen] Apache man Stalking Wolf described in detail how he respectfully harvested a sapling to make a bow in such a way that the overall forest benefitted, and the chosen tree yielded a powerful bow.[xxx-the vision|p80]

Can you imagine if your normal way of life benefitted the Earth around you, increasing the natural abundance that you depended on?

When people really bring out the best in each other, have high expectations, or hold each other to a high standard, we humans really are capable of maintaining that baseline of mutual respect among each other, and between people and the Earth.

In a sense, the Potawatomi, Apache, Nootka, and Crow are people like anyone else. They have attitudes, skills and awareness that anybody could cultivate -- including you and the people around you.

You could hold yourself and the people around you to a high standard of integrity. You and the people around you could cultivate physical resilience, mentor young people in a good way, and learn how to receive the Earth's gifts in a way that actually benefits the Earth.

<div class="rev-act-body">Think of a time when someone had faith in you, maybe even more faith than you had in yourself. Did someone help you find the self-respect to leave an abusive romantic relationship? Did a coach help you cultivate the discipline to train at your sport and be the best you could be? Did a teacher help you realize you could be great at whatever you put your mind to? Think of an example like this where someone really brought out the best in you, holding you to a high standard.<br/><br/>Now imagine being part of a group where everybody supported each other this way continually, in all areas of life. No one imposes their ideology on you, but they hold you to a high standard of excellent and beautiful behavior in your job, family life, social groups, and activism work, bringing out the best in you every day. And imagine you get to support others in the same way. How would that feel?</div></div>

### When People are discouraged from developing high standards and are rewarded for low standards, the outcome is dismal

Once people are conquered, and they accept being ruled in their unhealthy culture as normal and legitimate, _people's standards for themselves and each other drops a lot._ In other words, when a person or group finally considers it legitimate and ok to submit to authorities, they stop expecting very much of themselves or each other. People don't really expect life to be deeply meaningful, don't deeply trust others, or learn to focus mostly on themselves or pleasing others to keep life comfortable.

The underlying attitudes are things like, "Why bother cultivating deep integrity and bravery if I just want to keep my comfortable, predictable life and not rock the boat?" or "Why confront injustice if I don't trust others to stand with me, and if it wouldn't do any good anyway?"

As Part 2 showed, unhealthy cultures reward and encourage all our worst qualities, such as selfishness, cowardice, disconnection from each other and the Earth, ignorance, and superficiality. When people stop standing for what's right, and instead focus on keeping their job or wealth while staying out of trouble, these qualities can become widespread.










If a group of people wanted to form the seed of a new healthy culture, what would they need to do? In other words, what is a crucial first step on the path to the Deepest Revolution?

I believe one thing is crucial: _Hold yourself and others to the highest standards of excellent and beautiful behavior._

It takes deep spiritual strength to consistently hold yourself and others to such high standards. Fortunately, if you've been completing the revolutionary activities, you're already on the path of growing your spiritual strength.
