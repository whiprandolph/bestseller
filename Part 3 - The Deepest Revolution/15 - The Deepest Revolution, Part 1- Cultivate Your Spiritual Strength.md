## Chapter 15: The Deepest Revolution, Part 1: Cultivate Your Spiritual Strength

So many aspects of our way of life in unhealthy cultures keep us stuck. Your profit economy encourages you to focus on your own needs and make money just to survive. We are conditioned in countless ways about what to care about and what to ignore, and where to put our attention, time, and money. And so often in unhealthy cultures, many "conventional" or "mainstream" values are somehow superficial or misguided.

Growing up, I learned that the United States was the best country in the world, and I felt proud to live in a capitalist democracy. I looked forward to contributing to the United States' progress and growth throughout my life. As a church-going Christian, I bowed my head every night before dinner and prayed.

Over time, as I learned all the things that I share in this book, I had to give up a lot of beliefs -- beliefs about the society I live in, beliefs about history, beliefs about myself and the future, beliefs about what matters and what doesn't matter.

Giving up old beliefs and perspectives can be hard, even when it's obvious that they don't work. Don Cox described his own transformation. He had engaged in various kinds of activism to fight racial oppression in the US, but finally in 1967 he went to a conference where black people openly discussed oppression and revolution. Cox heard Black Panthers speak for the first time. He said, "I was drunk with this new world I had not even known existed. Pieces started falling into place. It was a cascade, a snowball rolling down the mountainside."[xxx-just another nigger|just another nigger]

Then he described how hard this was: "Everything I had heard during the weekend helped me understand that all the efforts I had made up until then to be acceptable to mainstream society had just made me a 'good nigger.' I was simultaneously ashamed and furious. All I could do was cry." Cox eventually dedicated himself to freeing black Americans from oppression, becoming a senior leader in the Black Panthers.

Bogaletch Gebre described her own powerful transformation. As a young adult, she underwent female genitual mutilation in Ethiopia, being taught that it made her a "whole woman." Later in life, a friend learned of this and felt horrified, and at first Gebre defended the practice as she had for years. Then she had her own transformation, as she "experienced an incredible awakening, then a tidal wave of anger, as I began to comprehend all that had been taken from me in ignorance... Tears of understanding flooded from me as I allowed the scientist in me to see, to examine in a new light, all that I remembered..." Gebre went on to lead a movement to abolish female genital mutilation.[xxx-original instructions|ethiopian women]

### Finding the Courage to Release What Doesn't Work

Giving up old beliefs is hard. Even Jesus Christ needed 40 days alone in the desert before he could fully confront the urge to seek wealth and power that his unhealthy culture instilled in him, and instead choose a path of service. After his transformation, he began a ministry that went on to inspire others for 2,000 years.

This kind of transformation seems common among activists and spiritual leaders. When you grow up in an unhealthy culture, you may be taught all kinds of hurtful or wrong things -- perhaps you learned that obedience is good and people are basically bad or naturally selfish (addressed in Chapters 7 and 9), that some people are worse than others or deserve to suffer (Chapter 10), that political and religious authorities serve the people (Chapter 8, 12 and 13), or that you live in a free society (Chapter 6).

But in order for Jesus Christ, Don Cox, Bogaletch Gebre, and many other spiritual leaders to truly serve their people, they had to go through transformations that helped them accept the truth and release the beliefs and attitudes that they knew were not working.

Giving up old beliefs is hard, but it becomes so much easier when you begin to see a better way. It's easier to give up on authoritarian democracy or divinely-ordained monarchy when you see how actually-free people choose their leaders. It's easier to give up submissive obedience when you see how people live freely, without fear of punishment. It's easier to trust yourself and trust others when you know how trustworthy people can be.

Embrace your curiosity, and open your mind to possibilities that may have seemed impossible before. As you free your mind from beliefs that don't work, and make space for perspectives that do, you will feel more empowered to make a difference for the people and nonhumans around you.

To live in a healthy culture, you will need to embrace a very different way of life than your unhealthy culture trained you for. A way of life without submissive obedience, where justice is normal and pervasive, where neighbors share generously and deeply trust each other, and the community's decisions take the Earth's needs into account. For a group to make this way of life real, each person will need 1) deep spiritual strength, 2) deep connections with other like-minded people, and 3) a deep connection with the Earth.**

_Part 3_ addresses these three themes. This chapter uncovers how to cultivate that spiritual strength, and the next chapter shares ways to form deep connections with others and with the Earth.**

<div class="rev-act-body">Reflect on your life, and think of one belief you have that isn't working. Do you keep voting, hoping someday the government won't be corrupt? Do you believe people are inclined to sin or that obedience is good or do you have shame about your body, and so you have self-doubt or low self-worth? Do you think rich people are better than poor, and you judge people by how much money they have instead of how much they serve the people around them? Do you believe other people are basically untrustworthy, and so you struggle to form many deeply trusting relationships?<br/><br/>Take some time and think of a belief or attitude that hasn't served you, and embrace one that might serve you better.</div></div>

### Cultivating Spiritual Strength, Part 1: Practice Noticing the Gifts You Receive and Feeling Grateful

Cultivating a practical, aware gratitude is the first step to build spiritual strength.

To me, a person has _spiritual strength_ if they give their deepest love in each moment without holding back, and if they stand for what's right for themselves and others. So what does that have to do with gratitude?

When I feel gratitude for others' gifts, it makes it hard for me not to give my own gifts in turn. I didn't understand this till I began nature connection practices and feeling grateful for all the gifts I received.

I started out seeing the forest as a "green wall" -- I liked walking through trees, but I hardly knew anything about them or the other creatures that lived there. I would have missed the forest if it was gone, but I mostly lived inside and focused on human affairs.

But I kept going to my sit spot to observe the nonhumans, and I kept studying my field guides and reference books, and listening to my mentors' stories and suggestions. And I learned how to receive the gifts of the Earth, so that as I walk around I literally see gifts everywhere I look.

The cedar and basswood trees offer me the tools to make fire, and now whenever I see these trees, I see the gift of fire, and all the fire's gifts such as warmth, cooking and camaraderie with friends.

Chestnut trees and oaks give the gifts of food, the same as herbs like chickweed or animals like deer and bear. All these give the gift of nutritious food, and joyful time with friends as we respectfully harvest, process, and eat the food together.

Stinging nettle has helped me relieve joint pain, and I've witnessed lobelia used in first aid to open a person's airways when they suffered a strong allergic response and struggled to breathe.

Yucca has offered me its leaves to make cordage, and miscanthus grass has helped me make a watertight roof to live under.

I learned to receive intangible gifts too -- the delight at seeing the sun reflect off the dew in the morning, or cooling off in a stream on a hot summer day. I was grateful to the plants I couldn't use directly, because they offered food and homes to birds and other animals that I was happy to have as company.

The more I learned to receive the Earth's gifts, and the more I practiced feeling grateful, the more I saw gifts everywhere I looked. I felt surrounded by abundance, and grateful for life.

And I kept driving past clear-cut forests, huge fields of empty clay destined to be shitty strip malls, dirty factories, and overpriced housing developments full of toxic building materials.

The more I felt the Earth's gifts in my bones, the deeper I felt the loss every time a river is polluted, or a forest is cut down.

Eventually, I just had to find ways to protect the forest. I couldn't bear to see the nonhumans I loved being killed in senseless ways.

I had an urge to protect the forest, an urge I couldn't ignore even if I wanted. I was too full of gratitude, too aware of the nonhumans' gifts to me and to each other, too aware of the divinity that lives in them just as it lives in me and all people -- so I couldn't ignore that urge to stand up for the rivers and forests I loved.

There may be many ways to cultivate passion and deep connection with others. But this deep gratitude helped me feel a love in my heart and desire to serve nonhumans I'd never experienced before. Earlier in life, I didn't give my sacred gifts to the nonhumans, and I didn't stand for what's right and protect them. But cultivating this practical, aware gratitude helped me get on a good path.

### Cultivating Spiritual Strength, Part 2: Cultivate Your Sacred Gifts and Give Them in Service of the People and Nonhumans you Love

When I study the great spiritual leaders I've found, something really stands out: it's like they're compelled to serve their people. It's as if they didn't have any choice in the matter.

Harriet Tubman was a black runaway slave during the times of US chattel slavery. When she finally reached the North, where chattel slavery was outlawed, her first thought was to return to her people and help them escape too.[xxx-harriet moses of her people]

In the coming years, she kept going back to help others escape, over and over. She was never caught, but if she had been, she'd have been tortured with unthinkable cruelty. But she loved her people so much, she was willing to accept the risk.

Tubman described the sense of being moved by a greater power very vividly. Whenever someone remarked on her courage or good fortune, she would say, "'Twan't me, 'twas de Lord! Jes' so long as he wanted to use me, he would take keer of me, an' when he didn't want me no longer, I was ready to go."

Jesus Christ and Martin Luther King Jr were the same -- both of them repeatedly acknowledged that they were going to die because of the ways they served their people, and yet they kept on serving in the deepest ways they knew how.

Like Tubman, both Martin Luther King Jr and Jesus Christ described a sense of being compelled by a higher power. Christ said he came "not to do my own will but the will of him who sent me."[xxx-bible|esv john 6:38] The night before he was killed, King said, "Longevity has its place. But I'm not concerned about that now. I just want to do God's will."[xxx-mlk final speech afscmd]

What is this greater power, or divine voice, that moves some people to act so selflessly even at great personal risk? And how come so few people seem to listen to it?

The truth is very simple: everyone has a divine voice in their heart that, from birth on, guides them to walk a deeply meaningful, dignified path in service of the people and nonhumans they love. However, in unhealthy cultures, people are subject to so much hurtful training that many learn to "hold back" or "shut down" parts of themselves, and ultimately they can learn to ignore that voice in their heart. People learn to obediently follow others' direction instead of follow their divine path, or embrace self-centeredness, low self-worth or distrust. People can learn to tolerate meaningless work. People can find ways to distract themselves from the dissatisfaction of not giving their deepest love in service of the people they love.

In other words, Tubman, King, and Christ only seem special because they gave their deepest love, or their sacred gifts, in unhealthy cultures that train people to hold back their love. They could feel that inner divine voice, whereas many people learn to ignore it, starting with early childhood deprivation or abuse and continuing with endless training for obedience throughout school, church and adulthood.

This is one universal spiritual truth behind the teachings of religions like Christianity, Islam, and Buddhism: everyone has sacred gifts to give, a divine purpose that only they can fulfill. And the divine voice inside you already knows that purpose, whether you consciously know it or not.

There is good news: if you are like me, and you learned to hold back your love or not discover your own sacred gifts or deep purpose, there are ways to access that part of yourself so that you can give yourself fully like Tubman, King, and Christ. It's simply a matter of releasing all distractions and temptations, and instead really listening to that inner divine voice inside you.

Some years ago, I felt stuck in life, so I decided to do a special fast alone in the woods. I had no water, no food, and no distractions -- no digital devices, no reading, nothing for 92 hours.

I spent most of the time feeling stressed, because I was so used to having distractions like my job, reading the news, even nervous eating. In other words, it took awhile to calm down and just be with that inner voice that I'd learned to ignore.

Before the fast, I often felt stressed, and it was difficult for me to savor sensual pleasures. I rarely even tasted my food, as I commonly read books or news articles or watched videos while I ate. I'd learned to distract myself from the dissatisfaction I was feeling.

I had no great insight during this fast. I just slowly calmed down. I never felt hungry, and only occasionally felt thirsty. But I knew from previous fasting what it's like to eat or drink water out of nervousness, so I knew not to worry, and my thirst quickly went away.

Finally I ended the fast with some herbal tea. As I savored the tea, I thought about how I would normally read or watch a video while drinking, and I was filled with revulsion. The thought of distracting myself from my own meaningful experience was terrible, even though just four days earlier it had seemed entirely normal.

This fast showed me how much I distracted myself from my own feelings, and how disconnected I was from that inner voice. Instead of walking a meaningful path, I was walking a comfortable path that didn't feel deeply meaningful, and I had learned to distract myself from the resulting dissatisfaction. The fast showed me how transformative it could be to simply release all distractions and connect with that inner divine voice.

In a sense, it felt like I was just "being myself," but I wasn't just "doing whatever I felt like." I was being my deepest self, connected with that inner voice that would never tolerate meaningless distractions as I walk a meaningful path.

It is essential to get rid of all distractions so that you can hear that divine voice, as many spiritual leaders have shown. Jesus Christ famously began his ministry immediately after fasting for 40 days alone in the desert, during which time he confronted temptations to become wealthy and powerful, and instead chose a path of service.[xxx-bible|matthew 4:1-11] Ohiyesa described how, among the traditional Sioux, praying alone in the wilderness "was customary with the best young men."[xxx-indian heroes and great chieftains|crazy horse] Apache man Stalking Wolf described how the vision quest "provides all the answers to life, to spirit," and it "brings forth the pure self untainted by any and all outside distractions," and ultimately "gives us a Vision, a command from the Creator, and a grand purpose to life."[xxx-the vision|p126]

"Command from Creator," "divine voice," "sacred gifts," and "deepest love" are all ways of saying the same thing. That divine voice is inside you right now, and it's waiting for you to listen so you can walk your divine path and offer your own sacred gifts, or your deepest love. All it takes is the courage to release distractions and feel that deepest part of you that others in your unhealthy culture haven't always welcomed.

You matter, and there's a reason you're alive. You have sacred gifts, special ways of making the world a better place that only you can give. Any moment you're not giving your gifts, the world becomes poorer.

Commit to discovering and giving your own sacred gifts, and living the most meaningful life imaginable in service of the people and nonhumans you love.

There are many ways to discover and give your gifts, as Chapter 3 described: you could learn how to fast safely and spend time away from people without distraction. Notice what sparks special joy or curiosity in your life. Ask friends to tell you when they've seen you be the most joyful and engaged. Notice your anger, and let that anger show you what you care about, and how you might act in service. If you choose to fast, I recommend the book _Fasting Can Save Your Life_ by Herbert Shelton.

In unhealthy cultures that train people for distraction, any of these practices can help reconnect you with that divine voice within you so that you can give your sacred gifts in life. These are life-long practices too, which will serve you well anytime you feel lost or stuck.

<div class="rev-act-body">Choose a time in the near future when you can avoid all distractions and feel into your heart to sense what most matters to you, or how you could give your deepest love.

### Cultivating Spiritual Strength, Part 3: Live in Reciprocity

Cultivating a practical aware gratitude and giving your sacred gifts are the first and second core spiritual practices, and they're the first two steps of cultivating a deep spiritual strength.

The third core spiritual practice, living in reciprocity, completes the puzzle.

I've met plenty of people who practice feeling gratitude. But if you're not giving your own sacred gifts from that place of gratitude, then it's still not fully satisfying.

And some people cultivate a passion, but if it's not offered in gratitude to the humans and nonhumans you love, what good is it?

Some people find passion for abstract things like scientific research, engineering, and writing. But when people merely find joy in their work and do not pay attention to the consequences of the work their bosses order them to do, terrible things happen. Physicists may love physics, and help create nuclear bombs their rulers use in ways they later regret. Civil engineers may obsess about building codes and construct well-built prisons that corrupt legal systems use to unjustly persecute activists and the poor.

Gratitude without service can feel empty, and passion without that clear gratitude can easily become comfortable and ultimately meaningless. Ruling classes are only too happy for wage slaves to feel passionate about their jobs.

It's the 3rd core spiritual practice that ultimately ties them all together, yielding a deep spiritual strength: living in reciprocity.

When you're grateful to other people and nonhumans, and you feel an unstoppable urge to act in service, everything changes. And when those other people and nonhumans need and expect your sacred gifts, or your deepest love, magic happens.

_Everything matters._

Harriet Tubman faced extreme risk as she worked to free enslaved people. This meant that every aspect of preparation and execution was extremely important. Not only was she fully present and aware of the risks, she conveyed this importance to the people she rescued.[xxx-harriet moses of her people]

For example, Tubman brought along a pistol, not only to protect herself from slavecatchers and their dogs, but also to keep the group together. The way was so difficult that men would sometimes give up, their feet sore and bleeding, claiming they could not take another step. They would say they were ready to die, or if their strength returned, go back to their old home. In order to protect the whole group from the torture and endless oppression they would face if they were caught, Tubman would point her revolver at the head of the exhausted man and say, "Dead niggers tell no tales; you go on or die!" Thus she ensured nobody could betray the group, even accidentally, and everyone escaped safely.

Can you imagine pointing a gun at someone whose life you wanted to save, and telling them to find their composure, or you'd have to kill them to protect the group?

A story from the Zapatistas shows how every moment matters, even in moments of joyful calm. Your energy ripples out into the world continuously, and just as your joyful presence can lift others' spirits, any disconnection, stress, or unawareness can likewise affect other people. Okhi Forest and her young daughter visited the Zapatistas, and at one point her daughter dropped a broom on the ground without thinking about it. A Mayan woman told Okhi's daughter, "Don't drop the broom carelessly like that, you can really affect a lot of people!"[xxx-original instructions|return ancient council]

It's not that every moment becomes "serious" or stressful; it's simply an attitude that the world is alive, and every moment is a gift, and not to be missed. Whether or not you give your deepest love matters, and the world and people around you expect nothing less.**

Your love could light up the world, but it's hard to keep giving alone. And it's hard to give if you don't feel very grateful.

When you cultivate deep relationships with other people and nonhumans, where each person is grateful for the other's gifts, then magic happens. It would be unthinkable to give less than your deepest love, as that's simply what people expect of each other in deep relationships. And of course, it's satisfying to give your love to people who are grateful for it.

But how to form such deeply trusting, reciprocal relationships, where people share their gifts generously, and feel grateful for the gifts they receive?

All the revolutionary activities in this book are meant to help you generate exactly these kinds of relationships. When you practice deep awareness and question your assumptions, you will really see other people for who they are, and who doesn't like being deeply seen by a caring person?

When you practice standing for what's right and supporting others who take a stand, you'll show a courage that inspires deep trust in others -- and who doesn't want to trust their friends?

When you practice giving first and giving without any expectation in return, that innocent generosity will inspire the same in others, who will know they can give to you and trust that over time you'll give back too.

When you practice noticing the gifts of the nonhumans and develop mutual relationships with them, you'll make more nonhuman friends than you ever imagined.

When you can cultivate deep relationships with people and nonhumans, they will give life a deep meaning all on their own. Your sacred gifts always matter, but you'll feel more energy to give your gifts when there are grateful people and nonhumans to receive them.

A person has spiritual strength if they give their deepest love in each moment without holding back, and if they stand for what's right for themselves and others. If you really commit to walking that most meaningful path, cultivating that practical aware gratitude, and living in reciprocity, I believe you'll find that spiritual strength that seems so elusive in unhealthy cultures.
