## What is a Healthy Culture Even Like?

For most of my life, I never thought there could be a whole society without racism, sexism, political corruption, pollution, injustice, or poverty. Every country I'd ever heard of had these troubles, so they seemed universal and normal, like a disease people had just learned to live with. 

But then I got to visit a nation where people live without these troubles -- without racism and sexism, without corruption or poverty. A place where sharing is a normal way of life. A place where neighbors deeply trust each other and visitors are treated like family.

I was blessed to live briefly in such a place. And no, itâ€™s not some cult or small commune, but a nation of thousands of people living across many villages. My short time there in 2015 was utterly magical and changed my life. An Englishman named Mike invited me to visit this nation with him, and he told me, "you will spend the rest of your life figuring out lessons to learn from these people."

Before we entered the Ashaninka's territory, Mike had told me how extremely generous they were, but even so I was constantly surprised at how giving they were. Whenever my host and I traveled around the region and felt like a rest, we would stop at the next house and the hostess would bring us their special fermented pink drink called peorentsi, as well as some simple and filling food. They didn't do this because I was special -- it was just normal for people to stop off at others' homes as they traveled, and to be received and fed without any expectation of trading or paying.

Dinners were likewise times of sharing, where people would bring the fish they'd caught, animals they'd hunted, and food they'd grown or found, and cook it up together over a fire in communal meals. No one counted who brought how much food, or who ate how much -- people just shared, and every meal was fun. I never understood what they were saying unless my host translated to Spanish, but their joy and laughter were infectious.

I was used to friends back home relating to work as a "grind" or "rat race," but I never noticed the Ashaninka grinding. One story really showed me how unstressful their work was: I once watched as an older woman was sitting on a mat on the ground, spinning cotton into yarn on a drop spindle. At first she sat upright, rhythmically working the drop spindle. After a while, she leaned over onto her elbow and worked the drop spindle from that position, and then leaned all the way over and took a nap with the spindle resting beside her. Eventually I glanced over again and saw her back in her original upright seated posture, working her spindle as she had at the start.

There was no boss, no doing unsatisfying work just to pay the bills. In fact I never saw anybody exchange money while I was there. She worked when she felt like working, and rested when she felt like resting, and she was the picture of relaxation the entire time.

Everywhere I looked, it was like they lived in a storybook that seemed too good to be true. Their kids were friendly and very capable. One little girl of around 5-6 showed me how to spin cotton into yarn, and she seemed like quite the expert. A boy of about 10 finished making an arrow as I watched, then invited me to target practice with his hand-made bow.

People seemed to take responsibility for their community. While I never saw any emotional outbursts or disputes, they were very willing to use violence to protect themselves. When walking between villages, I saw young men carry shotguns over their shoulders to protect from attacks by drug traffickers. 

When I arrived at one very far-away village, a small man greeted me with a very warm smile and helped me and my friends settle in. I later learned he was the village leader -- not because he had any special authority or power, but because that was how he served his neighbors. Because his house had no walls, I could clearly see this leader wasn't richer than anyone else, and he wasn't the leader because he was intimidating, or because of his parents.

Mike had also told me how extremely trustworthy these people were, and he was right again. I brought a large sack of goods with me as gifts, including material for fishing, sewing, cooking, and anything else Mike had said they would find useful. I estimated I spent hundreds of dollars on it all, and when they told me I could leave it in a home far from the village where I would be staying, I hesitated. But when I returned after 2 weeks with many Ashaninka to give out the gifts, I found the sack untouched, just as I had left it.

Given their integrity and generosity, I wasn't surprised to notice that they never seemed concerned with theft or robbery. I never saw a building with doors, much less locks, including where I'd left my sack. Few of their houses even had walls!

They seemed trustworthy, generous, capable, responsible, relaxed, joyful, and healthy -- not just one or two individuals, but everyone I found. There were no courts, no police or prisons. There was no government, though I did see people gathering in council on my last day as they discussed how to respond to Peruvians who were overfishing the nearby river.

Mike had told me I would spend the rest of my life figuring out what lessons to learn from the Ashaninka. And he was right about that too.

### Returning to the United States

I left the Ashaninka feeling both elated and confused.

A few months later, when I was talking with my father in Los Angeles, he asked me what I had learned. I teared up, as I still do today whenever I think about my time with the Ashaninka. I told my dad, "I don't know everything I learned. I'm still figuring it out. But I know this: people can live differently. We can treat each other well. I know it is possible, and I will never doubt it again because I saw it with my own eyes."

The more I looked around in my own culture, the United States, the more urgent it seemed to figure out those lessons. Deceit, selfishness, ignorance, and unnecessary misery seem pervasive.

For example, I was shocked to learn that the legal system doesn't actually guarantee Americans a fair trial like I learned growing up. It turns out that 98% of prisoners don't get a trial at all -- prosecutors commonly threaten people with decades in prison, and then offer them a plea bargain. People are offered a prison sentence of only a few years if they admit their "guilt", regardless whether they're guilty or not. Afraid of losing at trial due to racism, inability to afford a lawyer, police deceit, or other reasons, many people accept this offer. So for 98% of prisoners, the legal system and public have no idea whether they're actually guilty!

I realized that driving past a prison is like driving past a chattel slave plantation from two centuries ago: the slaves didn't "deserve" to be there; they were just captured and enslaved and put to work, or else they'd get punished. How are present-day prisoners in any different situation, if only 2% got a trial by jury where they actually got a chance to defend themselves in court? Prisoners cannot legally refuse to work either, just like chattel slaves of the past. The prison corporation owners are getting rich, and a lot of prison guards and staff have jobs, so it supports the "economy." But how is this predatory behavior ok?

Everywhere I look in my town, I see the same kind of corruption, each industry in its own way.

I went shopping for groceries, and found that almost everything for sale causes cancer, immune system disorders, developmental disorders, and other troubles: from pesticides in the food, to plastic wrapping, to non-stick coatings on pans. 

I left the grocery store and went to a pharmacy, and the same corruption there: drug after drug produced by pharmaceutical companies with a long track record of fraud, bribing government officials, manipulating research trials, funding huge amounts of misleading advertising, and more.

The Ashaninka don't have corruption like this. What lessons could I possibly learn from them to make this nightmare end?

I drive past all the major banks every day -- the same banks that keep getting "caught" every few years laundering money for drug cartels and human trafficking organizations, or forging legal paperwork to defraud homeowners, or blacklisting honest real estate appraisers, cheating their own customers, or whatever the next scam-of-the-day is.

These pharmaceutical companies and banks get dinged with little "cost of doing business" fines by the government, and nothing much changes. The predatory and selfish behavior continues -- not by outsiders, but mostly people within my own culture! Americans are taking advantage of other Americans. How come the Ashaninka are able to maintain respectful relations between everyone, and in America, it seems like rich Americans are the biggest threat that the poor Americans face?

I was amazed to discover that almost all of America's drinking water is now toxic, with different regions having their own mix of heavy metals, microplastics, and other chemicals. They were produced because the chemical and fossil fuel industries could make a big profit, so long as they didn't care about the toxicity of their products. I used to like going to a restaurant to relax, but if the water isn't safe without extensive filtration, how can I safely eat or drink anything at restaurants?

Forests keep getting cleared to make way for strip malls and suburban lots, while scientists sound the alarm that loss of forests is a major driver of climate change and the mass extinction happening right now.

I can't escape the hurtful behavior at home either. My middle-aged black roommate recently told me that some white men had yelled at her to go back to her own country, wherever that was supposed to be. Another female friend, an executive at an international corporation, tells me stories of sexism at her work anytime I ask her about her job!

These troubles put me in a pickle. I don't like being a downer, so when I'm with friends I mostly try to keep it light and positive. That means we mostly have superficial conversations, talking about our hobbies, jobs, houses, or other things. If we talked about the most important issues we faced, such as racism, sexism, pollution, corporate greed, dishonest and unaccountable politicians, and more... well, there'd be plenty of material for conversation, but it could be a downer pretty quick! And if it doesn't seem like we can do anything about it, then what's the point of acknowledging all these things anyway?

What am I supposed to learn from the Ashaninka about all this? How can they be humans like me and other Americans, and they live in such a beautiful way, and we don't?

Are the Ashaninka unique, and there's nothing really to learn anyway? Did the Ashaninka just get lucky, and Americans didn't? Could there be other nations like the Ashaninka, societies where people treat each other and the Earth in a respectful way, without discrimination, greed, and dishonest leaders? If so, could they help clarify the lessons that the Ashaninka have to offer?
