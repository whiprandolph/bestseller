## Meeting the Ashaninka

In 2015, I got to spend time with a nation without sexism or racism. There was no corruption, greed, pollution or child abuse. The people, called the Ashaninka, shared with each other as a normal way of life, took care of the Earth, and deeply trusted their neighbors. I quickly learned to trust everyone I met, and I felt grateful for how much they shared with me. This wasn't a cult or tiny village, but a nation of many villages. It was utterly magical and changed my life.

These people are called the Ashaninka, and on a map it looks like they live in eastern Peru in the Amazon rainforest. However, maps sometimes lie, and the Ashaninka don't live in Peru. The Peruvian government and laws are nowhere to be found! 

An Englishman named Mike Paul had been visiting them for over 30 years, and before we entered their territory, he had given me some very clear advice:

> _Bring them gifts. They are such kind and generous people that no matter how many gifts you bring them, you will wish you had brought more._

Mike was right. These loving people constantly shared their food without asking for anything in return. They taught me their language, how to spin cotton, and how to make friction fire. I danced with them, participated in ceremonies with them, laughed with them, sang with them, and played games with the adults and children. They gave me so much and were very welcoming.

Whenever guests came to visit someone's house, they would commonly sit in a circle on the ground and the woman of the household would bring out a large gourd full of peorentsi, a very pink and mildly alcoholic drink made from yuca and other root vegetables. Sitting on the liquid would be a smaller gourd they used as a cup.

My main host was a man in his early 20s named Andre. One day, we had planned to walk several miles to a village and he asked, "Would you like to go there directly, or would you like to take the long way and stop several times?" I asked to take the long way, and I'm glad I did. Every so often, the trail through the woods would open up into another household area and we would sit in a little clearing. Without any prior conversation, a woman would bring us a large gourd of peorentsi to drink. Sometimes we would talk, and sometimes we sat in silence. There was never any payment or trade. These women just shared with their guests as a normal practice. When we had rested enough and finished drinking, Andre and I would move on, only to find another home a little while later and repeat this again. I felt grateful every time for their warm welcome as if something miraculous had happened. They seemed to relate to this generosity like a normal thing.

They had a beautiful practice for sharing peorentsi. All the guests would sit in a circle on the ground, and the hostess would set the large gourd with peorentsi in front of somebody. It would only contain a single cup no matter how many people were present. By the time a woman gave me the drink one day, I knew what to do. I dipped the cup-gourd into the peorentsi and passed it to the person to my left. Then he passed it to the person to his left, till the cup traveled all the way around the circle. The last person would drink as much as they wished, then pass the cup all the way back around to me. Then I refilled the cup and passed it around, and the 2nd to last person would drink. Only after everyone had enough would I fill a cup for myself. It was the most social and connecting way of sharing a drink I had ever experienced. I never saw anyone eat alone.

In addition to being so generous, I was amazed at how relaxed the Ashaninka seemed. One of my favorite memories is of an older woman spinning cotton into yarn on a drop spindle. I sat with a few other people on the edge of a clearing, and she sat on a handwoven mat on the ground by herself 10-20 yards away. At first she sat upright, rhythmically working the drop spindle. Over the course of perhaps an hour, I watched an amazing transition. After a while, she leaned over onto her elbow and worked the drop spindle from that position, and then leaned all the way over and took a nap with the spindle resting beside her. Eventually I glanced over again and saw her back in her original upright seated posture, working her spindle as she had at the start. She was the picture of relaxation the entire time.

I believe I witnessed a few things here:

* _Meaningful work_: Ashaninka women commonly wove this yarn into bags and clothing for each other and the men. She wasn't weaving for someone else (such as a boss) to make money to pay bills which would keep uncaring people away (such as tax collectors or landlords). I never got to interview her about this, but I believe the work was directly meaningful to her in a way that paid work often is not.

* _Satisfying rhythm_: She was free to work or rest as she decided. I've observed managers in the United States shame people for not being a "hard worker" and threatening to fire people who didn't work hard enough on the boss's schedule. And so I'll notice workers (including myself) will work when they really don't feel like it, or when they're sick. This woman's grace showed me what it would be like to work when it's time to work, and rest when it's time to rest, and find satisfaction throughout.

I found this same graceful relaxation with the men, too. Several times, a group of older boys and men would want to travel from one village to another, and Mike and I would join them. On the way, we would stop and sit in a circle and rest. One thing really stood out: they laughed a lot! Even though I was studying their language, I never understood anything they said, but I always felt deeply at home and part of the group. Everything about them was so warm and relaxed. Once they looked at Mike and me, and someone made a comment and they all burst out laughing, and I had a moment where I expected to feel anxiety or distress at being laughed at. But then I noticed: there was nothing belittling or othering in their laughter. I never stopped feeling at home. 

The children were just as relaxed, and they were very competent. As I entered one village, the first person I encountered was a boy I estimated at 10 or 11 years old. Without any adult interaction, he was putting the finishing touches on a new arrow. I watched him carefully split a feather down the middle and attach each half to the rear. Soon the arrow was complete, and he'd apparently made an entire arrow by himself. He invited me to do some target practice with him. We walked over to a little clearing and we passed a handmade bow back and forth, shooting at a little log buried in the ground. I never saw anyone try to control the boy or impose any time restraints, or warn him about safety. He seemed relaxed and very capable, and the adults seemed to trust him to take care of himself. And he was a good shot!

I wanted to learn to spin cotton into yarn, and I asked the woman I lived with if she would show me and let me learn with her cotton. She seemed a little skeptical. I only ever noticed women spinning yarn. When I asked again a few days later, my hostess brought me some cotton and a drop spindle. It took me a long time to make a strand longer than an inch! I later learned that cotton is one of the most challenging fibers to spin because the fiber length is so short. I started feeling frustrated as I eventually got strands of 2-3". I heard giggling nearby, and I noticed several little girls were laughing at me!

One of the girls, about 5-6 years old, came and took the spindle and cotton from me. With grace and confidence, she spun that cotton as if the drop spindle were an extension of her body. She looked at me and smiled and handed back the spindle and cotton, and then she ran away without saying a word.

I thought, "Wow, it's like she's been spinning her whole life!" Then I realized that was true. I had watched mothers spin with infant children on their laps, and so the little girls learned the motions even before they could lift a spindle. No wonder this girl was an expert at the age of six!

I never observed money exchanging hands while I was there. I heard from Mike and also saw signs that they had only recently encountered money at all, and most didn't seem to use money or have any. I never saw any transactions where people traded with each other. Instead, people just shared everywhere I went. It was common for the men to leave home each day to hunt, fish, or work in the large gardens. Women commonly stayed closer to home, often working together to weave mats, make food or drinks, care for the kids, or take care of other needs.  I never noticed any disrespect towards the women or any extra burden on them. Even though men and women seemed to contribute to their family and community in different ways, everybody seemed to have the same respect for each other.

I also had an amazing experience with water, which started with a humble suggestion from one of my hosts: "would you like to go on a hike and see a special place?" After a steady walk through the rainforest, a group of 10-15 of us entered a clearing and I saw the most beautiful waterfall I'd ever seen. It fell down the side of a sheer cliff at least 40 feet high into a pond. On both sides, vibrant green moss shimmered under the water spray and golden sun.  I walked through the falling water to see the cliff while little children played in the pond. I drank from the falling water, just like I drank from local rivers without any filter or iodine tablets. It was the freshest water I'd ever tasted! 

There was no trash, no graffiti, no concrete or safety railings, no sign that humans had ever been there except the little dirt walking trail we'd arrived on. The waterfall's majesty left a big mark on me. It also showed me that humans could honor such a beautiful place, essentially indefinitely.

Even their leaders surprised me. When we arrived at their most distant village, Andre introduced me to the village's leader. He was a very unassuming man, with a small frame and a very warm smile. This leader never told us any rules or gave any orders. He showed Mike, Jillian, and me where we could sleep, make a cooking fire, and poop. Once we had no more questions, he went to his home. I sadly never learned his name, but I learned a great deal by watching him.

This village leader did not seem at all different from anybody else.  His home was the same as everyone else's: a pavilion with 6 posts and a thatched roof. No homes in this village had walls. Some possessions like mats were kept on the ground, and items like fire making kits were kept tucked under the thatch in the roof. Thus I could tell that this village leader also did not have more possessions than anyone else; that is, he wasn't materially richer. He dressed the same as everyone else. He played games with other adults and children and me in a big clearing, including a big game of soccer one day with a ball of rags tightly wrapped in cordage. There was nothing imposing or threatening about him, so he wasn't a leader because he was a bully. Nor did he seem like a fool who was only a leader because of his possessions or parents. We never had any trouble, but I knew that if we did, I could bring it up and we would work through it. I felt just as comfortable around this leader as around everyone else.

In other words, he seemed like a normal man who took on extra responsibilities to help the village run smoothly but had no extra authority or power. Years later, I realized this was what it was like to have a community with strong leaders and no rulers.

The villages were very peaceful. I never saw any conflict or upset feelings, including among children. However, they were also very willing to use violence to protect themselves. I learned that the Peruvian drug wars in the 1980s had cost many Ashaninkans their lives. Several times when we walked between villages, young men brought along shotguns to protect the traveling group. I wished I could help them protect themselves somehow. At least I was able to buy them some shotgun shells from a distant market!

The whole time I stayed with them, they never asked me for anything. I never paid them anything, whether in money or bartered food or anything else, although I did share the food I brought in with me. But I sure felt a continuous desire to give back to them.

Luckily, I had trusted Mike when he said I would want to give them gifts. Before leaving the town where I had stayed in Peru, I'd asked Mike for a list of all the items the Ashaninka might value. I went to the market and filled a huge sack full of knives, fishing equipment, sewing equipment, cloth, food, and every other tool or material they might want. I was not going to show up unprepared!

And yet... Mike was right. I still wished I had brought more. After a few weeks living inland, several men, women and children went with Mike and me back to the Ashaninka river-side village where we'd left our sacks of goods. Nobody counted time in hours or minutes there, so I don't know how long it took to give out everything. They smiled warmly and nodded as they pulled the gifts out of the bag. I could tell they approved and welcomed all the gifts even though there was little emotion and they did not say much. By then I was so used to non-verbal communication with them that I knew everything was going great. I felt sad when my sack was finally empty and I had no more gifts to give!

Even this experience amazed me though. There were about 2,000 Ashaninkan people spread over about a dozen villages. Some had never used money, and some sold cacao to traders at a river-side market. I estimated that the highest yearly income of any Ashaninka person was less than what I'd spent on the gifts in my bag. Yet my bag sat in a home with no doors or locks for weeks, even while I was multiple days' hikes away. When I returned, nothing was missing. The bag was untouched. Mike had told me these people were extremely honest, and I could trust them with anything. And he was right again.

Mike had told me something else before we arrived at the Ashaninkas' villages:

> _You will spend the rest of your life figuring out lessons to learn from these people._

Mike was right about that too. A few months later, when I was talking with my father in Los Angeles, he asked me what I had learned. I teared up, as I still do today whenever I think about my time with the Ashaninka. I told my dad, "I don't know everything I learned. I'm still figuring it out. But I know this: people can live differently. We can treat each other well. I know it is possible, and I will never doubt it again because I saw it with my own eyes."

The more I looked around in my own culture, the United States, the more urgent it seemed to figure out those lessons. The deceit, selfishness, ignorance, and unnecessary misery seem pervasive.

I was shocked to learn recently that the legal system doesn't actually guarantee Americans a fair trial like I learned growing up. It turns out that 98% of prisoners don't get a trial at all -- prosecutors commonly threaten people with decades in prison, and then offer them a plea bargain. People are offered a prison sentence of only a few years if they admit their guilt, regardless whether they're guilty or not. So for 98% of prisoners, the legal system and public have no idea whether they're guilty! Driving past a prison is like driving past a chattel slave plantation from two centuries ago: the slaves didn't "deserve" to be there; they were just captured and enslaved and put to work, or else they'd get punished. How are present-day prisoners in any different situation, if only 2% got a trial by jury where they actually got a chance to defend themselves in court? The prison corporation owners are getting rich, and a lot of prison guards and staff have jobs, so it supports the "economy." But how is this predatory behavior ok?

Everywhere I look in my town, I see the same kind of corruption, each industry in its own way.

I went shopping for groceries, and found that almost everything for sale causes cancer: from pesticides in the food, to plastic wrapping, to non-stick coatings on pans. 

I left the grocery store and went to a pharmacy, and saw the same thing: drug after drug produced by pharmaceutical companies with a long track record of fraud, bribing government officials, manipulating research trials, spending on huge amounts of misleading advertising, and more.

What lessons am I supposed to learn from the Ashaninka? What would make this nightmare end?

I drive past all the major banks every day -- the same banks that keep getting "caught" laundering money for drug cartels and human trafficking organizations, or forging legal paperwork to defraud homeowners, or blacklisting honest real estate appraisers, cheating their own customers, or whatever the next scam-of-the-moment is.

These pharmaceutical companies and banks get dinged with little "cost of doing business" fines by the government, and nothing much changes. The predatory and selfish behavior continues -- not by outsiders, but mostly people within my own culture! Americans taking advantage of other Americans. How come the Ashaninka were able to maintain respectful relations between everyone, and in America, it seems like rich Americans are the biggest threat that the poor Americans face?

I was amazed to discover that almost all of America's drinking water is now toxic, with different regions having their own mix of heavy metals, microplastics, and other chemicals. I used to like going to a restaurant to relax, but if the water isn't safe, how can I eat or drink anything at restaurants?

Forests keep getting cleared to make way for strip malls and suburban lots, while scientists sound the alarm that loss of forests is a major drive of climate change and the mass extinction happening right now.

I can't escape the hurtful behavior at home either. My middle-aged black roommate recently told me that some white men had yelled at her to go back to her own country, wherever that was supposed to be. Another female friend, an executive at an international corporation, will tell me stories of sexism at her work anytime I ask her about her job!

These troubles put me in a pickle. I don't like being a downer, so when I'm with friends I mostly try to keep it light and positive... which ends up meaning we have superficial conversations, talking about our hobbies, jobs, houses, or other things. If we talked about the most important issues we faced, such as racism, sexism, pollution, corporate greed, dishonest and unaccountable politicians, and more... well, there'd be plenty of material for conversation, but it could be a downer pretty quick! And if it doesn't seem like we can do anything about it, then what's the point of acknowledging all these things anyway?

what am I supposed to learn from the Ashaninka about all this? It's like they're a different species. How can they be Homo sapiens like me and other Americans, and they live in such a beautiful way, and we don't?

Are the Ashaninka unique, and there's nothing really to learn anyway? Did the Ashaninka just get lucky, and Americans didn't? Could there possibly be other nations like the Ashaninka, societies where people treat each other and the Earth in a respectful way, without discrimination, greed, and dishonest leaders? If so, could they help clarify the lessons that the Ashaninka have to offer?












"Shocked to discover that..."

Share my own emotions, my own awakening.



Ok, so it feels shitty being around grocery stores, pharmacies, prisons, and banks. I mean, it's not so bad if I don't think about anything very much; I can just sort of go about my business with my head down and be ok. And most employees have no idea when I ask them questions; they mostly seem like honest, hard-working people just trying to keep their job, whatever that means for them. It's like I'm surrounded by a few rich crooks and tons of people who need a job and try not to think about the crooks.

If I just stuck to celebrity news and the politics they talk about on TV, I wouldn't have this problem. Grocery stores and prisons would seem fine! It's tempting to forget what I've learned, sometimes.

What the fuck am I supposed to learn from the Ashaninka about this? Their life is so different, it's like they live on a different planet!

Mostly politicians seem to ignore these things. Some talk about it, but... mostly that just seems all there is to it. Just so much talk. And nothing much seems to change, no matter how elections go, election after election. The sexism, racism, greed, pollution, poverty just keep happening!

It's hard to pull lessons from just one example. It takes two points to draw a line, and a lot more examples to see a pattern. Could there possibly be other nations like the Ashaninka, societies where people treat each other and the Earth in a respectful way, without discrimination, greed, and dishonest leaders? If so, could they help me learn the lessons the Ashaninka have to offer?
