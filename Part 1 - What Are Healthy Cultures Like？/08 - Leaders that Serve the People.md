The first two core spiritual practices are cultivating a practical aware gratitude and giving one's sacred gifts. The first practice is receiving graciously, and the second practice is giving. Giving and receiving are complementary practices, and it takes both to make a healthy culture.

Much cultural research focuses on leaders like kings, presidents, and business executives. However, followers and leaders play equally important roles, and any individual can be a leader in one situation and a follower in another. Strong leaders cannot exist without strong followers. Gracious givers need gracious receivers.

Gracious receiving makes space for others' gifts. Daniel and I had to graciously receive Marina's gifts to make space for her. In that context, she was the giver, and we learned to receive Marina's gifts of curiosity and desire to learn.

Everyone plays the role of follower or receiver in countless ways, and if we play this role graciously, we encourage others to give their gifts. When a person plays this role poorly, they discourage the gifts.

Consider two people discussing some trouble. The "giver" is the speaker and the "receiver" is the listener. Both have a responsibility to ensure they develop a shared understanding of reality. The speaker's responsibility is to speak honestly. The listener's responsibility is not to make assumptions.

In a normal conversation, two people take turns, and each is responsible for speaking honestly and listening with an open mind. But these responsibilities also exist when people spread rumors about an event they did not witness. Do listeners falsely assume that what they hear is true without verifying? Or do listeners go to witnesses to find out the truth directly?

False rumors wouldn't spread if people didn't make thoughtless assumptions. I know several people, including myself, who have had false rumors spread to dozens of people in a community, and it can generate a sense of deep insecurity. There is little any individual can do to keep others from making foolish assumptions and believing hurtful rumors. Each individual needs to accept that "receiver" responsibility to either seek the truth or accept their own ignorance.

When people consistently avoid making assumptions, everyone can feel secure knowing that their neighbors won't propagate hurtful misunderstandings about them.

Another important receiver or follower responsibility is acknowledging excellent behavior. Practical, aware gratitude is a core spiritual practice in part because giving gratitude encourages people to continue doing good things.

Consider Martín Prechtel's summary of the Tzutujil Mayan system for choosing leaders:

> Traditional Tzutujil loved to get more than someone else, just so they could dress fancily and give it all away to be big. To get anywhere in traditional Mayan society, you had to work really hard to get wealth, get appointed to office without campaigning, and then give it all away.[xxx-secrets of the talking jaguar|p210]

The Tzutujil Mayans encouraged giving by recognizing the givers. For that to work, people had to notice each others' giving and honor it.

How could a society possibly have leaders who don't seek office? This required people to notice the givers and name them as leadership candidates. They couldn't have strong leaders without strong followers who looked out for the best leadership candidates and lifted them up.

A culture that wants humble leaders must have strong followers who notice excellent behavior and highlight it so that everybody sees.

The same works for any quality that a culture wants to encourage. Consider bravery. Wikis' uncle gave him this advice: "When you are at war you may do brave things, and other people will see what you have done, and will tell of it. If you should chance to perform any brave act, do not speak of it; let your comrades do this; it is not for you to tell of the things that you have done."[xxx-when buffalo ran|the way to live]

Wikis' uncle encouraged a deep humility in him, training Wikis not to brag. But how will a person's reputation grow if they don't brag about themselves? Wikis' uncle said that other people would tell of his brave feats. In other words, they would share each others' great stories, rewarding and honoring each other's gifts. When people can trust that others will tell of their good deeds, they will feel less pressure to brag.

Black Elk described a Lakota ceremony they held after a battle where people were "having kill talks all over the village, remembering brave deeds done in the fight..."[xxx-black elk speaks|the rubbing out of long hair] Warriors could die knowing that they and their contributions would not be forgotten, but celebrated and remembered. The Lakota encouraged the gift of brave sacrifice by receiving it graciously with gratitude.

Wikis described a similar ceremony. After one battle, people blackened their faces, and the "old men and old women shouted the names of those men who had been the bravest in the fight."[xxx-when buffalo ran|attack on the camp]

Ohiyesa described how gracious receiving was a normal part of child-rearing in his Sioux culture. Parents constantly celebrated their children's progression into adulthood, both praising and modeling the qualities they wanted their children to embrace. He wrote, "[the child's] first step alone, the first word spoken, first game killed, the attainment of manhood or womanhood, each was the occasion of a feast and dance in his honor, at which the poor always benefited to the full extent of the parents' ability."[xxx-indian heroes and great chieftains|crazy horse] The parents honored their children's gifts by graciously receiving them with celebration.

This shows me the power each person has to build a beautiful culture as a follower, receiver, or witness. Practice noticing and praising excellent behavior. Give thanks at least in private, and also in public when appropriate.

Systems of accountability are the boundary-setting that discourage unwanted behavior. Praise, gratitude, and sharing stories of others' good deeds are ways of giving positive reinforcement to encourage more excellent behavior. Anyone can receive graciously and encourage the kind of behavior they want to see in the world.

### From elsewhere in ODOC

#### Red Cloud story from chap 4
It takes a deep wisdom and collective effort to decide when and how violence may be used productively. If people act violently out of ignorance or selfishness, it does not help. When the American general Harney convinced Ogallala chief Bear Bull to force his clan to submit to American dictates, the clan refused. In a drunken rage, Bear Bull angrily fired at his own people and killed Red Cloud's father and brother. Red Cloud calmly faced Bear Bull and his son who tried to defend him and he killed them both. Ohiyesa noted that "He did what he believed to be his duty, and the whole band sustained him. Indeed, the tragedy gave the young man at once a certain standing, as one who not only defended his people against enemies from without, but against injustice and aggression within the tribe. From this time on he was a recognized leader."[xxx-indian heroes and great chieftains|red cloud]

Red Cloud did not kill the abusive, corrupt chief to take power for himself. He killed the corrupt chief to reestablish the baseline of mutual respect, and his neighbors recognized this. This is how a culture can have strong leaders and no rulers. Red Cloud became a leader because people recognized him as someone who stood against injustice to his people wherever it came from.

#### Balanced leadership from sexual equality vs discrim

Scholars have debated for centuries whether it is possible for men and women to be treated with equal respect in society. Some scholars have concluded that sexual equality is impossible.[xxx-commodity exchange and subordination] Once I studied healthy cultures, I discovered the answer: not only is it possible, sexual equality is common in cultures without rulers.

### Healthy Cultures Seek a Balance Of Feminine and Masculine Leadership

Balance is a common theme among every healthy culture I've studied.

Having both strong men and strong women contributing to the culture brings balance in many helpful ways. In his writings about the Tzutujil Mayan leadership, Martín Prechtel wrote, "It was not that a man or woman was incomplete without the other; it was that the village was imbalanced otherwise."[xxx-secrets of the talking jaguar|p202]

Male and female partners would serve as chiefs together except in special circumstances. Even Tzutujil Mayan gods came in pairs.

Different healthy cultures have found very different ways of achieving this balance. Cherokee woman Rebecca Adamson described how the traditional Cherokee would have a White Council of women who led during peacetime and a Red Council of men who led in war. She said, "The goal was the balance, the harmony, the bringing together of both wisdoms and both energies for the good of the Nation."[xxx-original instructions|first nations survival]

In other healthy cultures, trusted elder women may be responsible for picking the male leaders or picking candidates for leadership who then go on to get further approvals. The eldest healthy woman in every Huron clan was designated the clan matron, responsible for choosing both a civil chief and a war chief.[xxx-illustrated native american|p156]

Onondaga chief Oren Lyons described how, when a chief position opens up in the Haudenosaunee Confederacy, a clan mother is trusted to choose a male candidate from her clan to begin the approval process. If her clan reaches consensus in support of the candidate, then the process continues; otherwise she must pick somebody else. Once the clan reaches consensus, the candidate then goes through several more rounds of approval, including full acceptance by the council of chiefs. While the chiefs meet to consider the candidate, men without titles stay home to prepare food so the women may attend the meetings and observe closely. In this role, women keep the records and teach the children.[xxx-original instructions|a democracy based on peace]

Finally, after all the other approvals, the candidate chief is presented to the people, and they are asked if anyone knows a reason why the man should not be chief. As Lyons said, "the final word is the people. That is democracy in its full form." He described what sort of man the community would typically choose as a leader: "He must simply be a man of good health and courage, a family man, responsible and honest." In both the Huron and Haudenosaunee, trusted elder women must first choose the men who go on to hold leadership positions.

Even when the men lead in healthy cultures, I find that they highly value women's input. For example, in February 1757, when male Cherokee leader Attakullakulla went to South Carolina to discuss trade agreements with the governor, he was surprised to see no white women present. Cherokee women commonly advised their council on issues of peace and war, so it was strange not to see any women in the white people's council.

The Cherokee leader asked, "Since the white man as well as the red was born of woman, did not the white man admit women to their councils?" The South Carolina governor was so surprised that he took a few days to respond, saying, "The white men do place confidence in their women and share their councils with them when they know their hearts are good." The Cherokee were not convinced.[xxx-cherokee women in crisis|p1]

In another example where male leaders welcomed women's input, Crow woman Pretty Shield described a time when they were traveling in a group of about 60 households and they had lost track of where their enemies were during the move. They were quite hungry and men went off hunting buffalo before all the lodges were put up.

A woman named Little Face opened a food pouch and discovered a woman mouse with her children. Little Face did not disturb them, but retrieved food from another pouch and went to sleep. In a dream, she heard the mouse exclaim, "My friend! In four days your people will be attacked by the Lakota. Can you make the men believe this, get them to go back to the place that you came from?" The mouse knew there were many more Lakota than Crow, and she was worried for her children.

Little Face told her mother of her dream and began packing immediately. Her mother found Red Bear, leader of the whole community, watching the countryside from a hill top. Red Bear knew she would not signal him unless it was important, so he listened. He said, "I, too, have felt that some trouble was near us," and he quickly responded to bring in the hunters. When he reached them, they had just found a dead cow with a fresh Lakota arrow in it, and they were ready to heed Little Face's warning. They all packed up and left, avoiding trouble.

Little Face continued to feed the mother mouse and her babies, allowing them to stay in her pouch till the young mice ran away. Then the woman mouse told Little Face where she wanted to be let go, and Little Face took her there. Before the mother mouse left, she looked at Little Face and said, "I will always hear you if you call me." After this, Little Face never stepped on mouse holes in the ground. She considered the mice her special medicine who helped her. And the community's leader, Red Bear, would often ask Little Face for her advice in the future.

These stories and many others show healthy cultures embracing a balance of male and female input in making important decisions.
