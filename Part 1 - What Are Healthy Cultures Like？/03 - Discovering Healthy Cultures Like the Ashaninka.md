It's funny -- one of the most amazing aspects of the Ashaninkan culture was something I didn't even notice until after I had left.

They didn't have police, and they didn't have prisons. And yet, they seemed very relaxed, and didn't seem at all concerned about crime.

Long before I even thought about "healthy cultures," I kept reading about other Europeans and Americans visiting them, and these observers all noticed the same thing: French missionaries visited the Huron in North America in the 1600s, and were shocked that thousands of people could get along so well without police and prisons. Weston Price, an American dentist, visited many healthy cultures around the world in the 1930s and wrote, "few impressions can be more vivid than that of the absence of prisons and asylums." Benjamin Franklin observed healthy cultures of eastern North America and noticed the same thing: "All their government is by Counsel of the Sages. There is no Force; there are no Prisons, no officers to compel Obedience, or inflict Punishment."

I kept reading these kinds of observations, from people all around the world, and I thought about the police and prisons where I live. The United States spends huge amounts of money on prisons and police, and yet there continues to be so much crime and political corruption. How come some nations live without police and prisons, and also seem to avoid crime? And how come the nations with police and prisons have so much crime?

And it's not like healthy cultures don't have trouble -- in any society, sometimes people don't get along. But I kept reading about ways they addressed disputes that seemed to really help maintain a baseline of mutual respect among everybody, holding people to high standards of good behavior and helping people get along without humiliating or punishing them too harshly.

Priscilla Settee, a woman of the Cree people, described their reconciliation process where elders would consider how to bring a person "back into a balanced life" and help them "focus on what is important in life." Instead of believing that a troubled person is bad and deserves punishment, this more loving approach recognizes that the troubled person is basically good but off-balanced or missing something important. The goal is to help them recover their balance.

The Ju/'hoan San (these punctuation symbols refer to sounds that don’t exist in English) have healing dances for people who aren't getting along, where they "put these two people next to each other so that they can come into harmony by dancing together... it's a technology of opening the heart so that healing energy can enter and so that people's hearts will be revealed to each other and any problems or enmity will go out from between them."

In these kinds of societies, I often notice that misbehaving people get counseled at first, and the response escalates if the misbehavior continues. This gives people a chance to course-correct without the extreme stress, danger, isolation, and humiliation that comes from being imprisoned.

Traditional Potawatomi emphasized sharing and strongly discouraged selfishness. Potawatomi woman Robin Kimmerer explained how anyone who took too much, to the detriment of the community, was "first counseled, then ostracized, and if the greed continued, they were eventually banished..." 

And while I found a few stories of healthy cultures banishing or killing someone for severe misbehavior, like hoading wealth or killing someone in anger, this seemed very rare.

All these cultures seem so different, each with their own ways of helping people get along, resolving disputes, and addressing anybody's selfish or hurtful behavior. But one way or another, each of these cultures has or had ways of maintaining a baseline of mutual respect among each other. That is, regardless how they treat outsiders, they seem to be able to maintain solidarity and respectful relationships between everyone inside the culture as a normal way of life.

I had found plenty of stories of individual Americans or small groups acting with kindness to each other regardless of how much money they had -- but never everyone in the entire nation, or in a whole town. And yet as I kept studying these cultures that seem so beautiful, I found stories of whole towns or whole nations acting with kindness to every member. 

Nancy Basket, a woman of Cherokee descent, offered one example. She described how, when traditional Cherokee towns got larger than 600-700 people, they became too big because hunting and foraging became difficult. The town needed to split into two. After agreeing on the new town site, often about seven miles away, everyone would go build the new buildings and homes regardless whether they were planning to move or not. They even made sure all the gardens were planted.

People would go back and forth between the new and old sites as they prepared the new town. They did not create winners and losers, where the winners stayed and the losers had to go off and fend for themselves and build a house alone. Instead, everyone took responsibility for their neighbors' wellbeing. Following the golden rule, each person treated the others the way they would want to be treated.

In story after story, I noticed in these healthy cultures that they don't just stand in solidarity with each other -- they also stand in solidarity with the Earth. In other words, they don't just take care of each other, they take care of the nonhumans they live with.

The Sioux led the Dakota Access Pipeline protests in 2016 in North America, seeking to protect the water from oil spills. In 2010, the Indian government evicted many Jenu Kuruba people from their ancestral land, supposedly to protect local populations of endangered tigers. The Jenu Kuruba noted that the tiger population was so high where they lived precisely because they worship the tigers, as well as the other nonhumans. The Jenu Kuruba demanded to return and that the Indian government stop giving mining companies leases on their homeland.

In Africa, the Mbuti likewise rejected a government so-called "conservation" effort that tried to force them off the land even while companies came to dig for gold. One hunter named Mapenzi said, "We know how to protect our forest because nobody knows it the way we do. We know where the animals give birth, where they sleep and during which periods one must never kill them... The animals that the modern law wants to conserve are already under our customary protection. These are the laws our ancestors established." Stories from other nations in northern Asia, South America and around the world show whole nations of people similarly living in solidarity with Earth as well as each other.

### Trustworthy and Generous

The more I read, the more I found stories of nations that currently or in the recent past seem like the Ashaninka in other ways too. Superficially they were different -- Eskimos in northern North America might have very different clothes, food, or ceremonies than the Gumbaynggirr of Australia, or the Jenu Kuruba in Asia -- but I kept noticing deep, beautiful patterns that they all share in common. 

Besides the lack of police and prisons, I also noticed observers remarking on their integrity. Ohiyesa was a Sioux man born in North America in the 1800s, and when he visited an American city, he said, "I was cautioned against trusting strangers, and told that I must look out for pickpockets. Evidently there were some disadvantages connected with this mighty civilization, for we Indians seldom found it necessary to guard our possessions."

American S.M. Barrett described having complete trust in Apache leader Geronimo, saying, "When he once gives his word, nothing will turn him from fulfilling his promise." Stanley Vestal and George Grinnell described how they found the Sioux and Cheyenne people completely trustworthy, sounding just like my experience with the Ashaninka.

I remember first reading about Geronimo's integrity, and my mind went to all the untrustworthy politicians in the United States -- but also every other country I'd visited, including Ecuador, Peru, Germany, Great Britain, Canada, and more. Some individuals in these countries are trustworthy, but none of these nations has anything like the universal integrity I'd experienced with the Ashaninka, or like these other observers in the 1800s experienced with the Sioux, Cheyenne, and many other beautiful cultures.

And it's not just trustworthiness -- I kept finding stories of incredible generosity, not just occasionally but as a normal way of life for the whole nation.

Jesuit Christian missionaries in the 1600s noted that the Huron would never let someone go without food or shelter. When someone's house burned down in the Huron village Ossossane, their neighbors came together to build them a new one. They did not have markets for trading or bartering, but instead embraced hospitality, gift-giving, and ceremonial exchanges. Visitors to a village were given food and shelter for as long as they wished to stay.

The Huron would publicly announce whenever someone donated a large amount towards a feast, funeral, or ceremony, and this raised the donor’s status. People thus enjoyed accumulating goods so that they could give away as much as possible, and thus earn their neighbors' gratitude. Feasts were common as people sought to build up their stash of food only to give it away.

How amazing would it be to live in a society where people don't accumulate wealth to hoard it and enrich themselves, instead gathering wealth so they can give away as much as possible to their neighbors? This wasn't unique to the Huron. Martín Prechtel described how the Tzutujil Mayans had a "self-impoverished theocracy" where people "loved to get more than someone else, just so they could dress fancily and give it all away to be big." Prechtel wrote how the Tzutujil Mayans became leaders: "To get anywhere in traditional Mayan society, you had to work really hard to get wealth, get appointed to office without campaigning, and then give it all away." Each time a leader rose to a new level in their hierarchy, he or she gave away all their things so that they were equally as impoverished as everyone else.

These stories would have seemed almost unbelievable if I hadn't seen this sort of generosity with my own eyes during my time with the Ashaninka.

All these stories showed me that the beauty of the Ashaninkas isn't unique. Every culture is unique in its own ways. But while every culture has its own unique ways of gathering food, every culture has some way of gathering food. Likewise, each of these beautiful cultures I found has had their own unique ways of maintaining a respectful way of life with each other -- but they all, one way or another, do or did maintain a respectful way of life among everybody. They embrace integrity and generosity, and have systems of conflict resolution that work while avoiding punitive police and prisons. Because generosity was or is so common, they didn't have rich people and poor people, and governments that pretend to serve the people while actually serving the rich.

Still... how do all these nations maintain such a beautiful way of life? And why are some cultures so unhealthy in comparison, with widespread greed, corruption, poverty, and untrustworthy behavior? What lessons could I learn from the Ashaninka and all these other cultures about how to live in such a beautiful way?
