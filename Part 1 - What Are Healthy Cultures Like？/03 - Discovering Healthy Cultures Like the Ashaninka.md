## Chapter 3: Discovering Healthy Cultures Like the Ashaninka

<toc/>
<toc/>

It's funny -- one of the most amazing aspects of the Ashaninkan culture wasn't something I even noticed until after I had left.

They didn't have police, and they didn't have prisons. And yet, they seemed very relaxed, and didn't seem at all concerned about crime.

Long before I even thought about "healthy cultures," I kept reading about other Europeans and Americans visiting them, and these observers all noticed the same thing: French missionaries visited the Huron in North America in the 1600s, and were shocked that thousands of people could get along so well without police and prisons. Weston Price, an American dentist, visited many healthy cultures around the world in the 1930s and wrote, "few impressions can be more vivid than that of the absence of prisons and asylums." Benjamin Franklin observed healthy cultures of eastern North America and noticed the same thing: "All their government is by Counsel of the Sages. There is no Force; there are no Prisons, no officers to compel Obedience, or inflict Punishment."

I kept reading these kinds of observations, from people all around the world, and I thought about the police and prisons where I live. The United States spends huge amounts of money on prisons and police, and yet there continues to be so much crime and political corruption. How come some nations live without police and prisons, and also seem to avoid crime? And how come the nations with police and prisons have so much crime?

And it's not like they didn't have trouble -- in any society, sometimes people don't get along. But I kept reading about ways they addressed disputes that seemed to really help maintain a baseline of mutual respect among everybody, holding people to high standards of good behavior and helping people get along without humiliating or punishing them too harshly.

Priscilla Settee, a woman of the Cree people, described their reconciliation process where elders would consider how to bring a person "back into a balanced life" and help them "focus on what is important in life." Instead of believing that a troubled person is bad and deserves punishment, this more loving approach recognizes that the troubled person is basically good but off-balanced or missing something important. The goal is to help them recover their balance.

The Ju/’hoan San (these punctuation symbols refer to sounds that don’t exist in English) have healing dances for people who aren't getting along, where they "put these two people next to each other so that they can come into harmony by dancing together... it's a technology of opening the heart so that healing energy can enter and so that people's hearts will be revealed to each other and any problems or enmity will go out from between them."

In these kinds of societies, I often notice that misbehaving people get counseled at first, and the response escalates if the misbehavior continues.

Traditional Potawatomi emphasized sharing and strongly discouraged selfishness. Potawatomi woman Robin Kimmerer explained how anyone who took too much, to the detriment of the community, was "first counseled, then ostracized, and if the greed continued, they were eventually banished..." 

And while I found a few stories of healthy cultures banishing or killing someone for severe misbehavior, like hoading wealth or killing someone in anger, this seemed very rare.

All these cultures seem so different, each with their own ways of helping people get along, resolving disputes, and addressing anybody's selfish or hurtful behavior. But one way or another, each of these cultures has or had ways of maintaining a baseline of mutual respect among each other. That is, regardless how they treat outsiders, they seem to be able to maintain solidarity and respectful relationships between everyone inside the culture as a normal way of life.

And so many stories show how beautiful life is when a culture is able to maintain this solidarity and mutual respect. Nancy Basket, a woman of Cherokee descent, described how, when traditional Cherokee towns got larger than 600-700 people, they became too big because hunting and foraging became difficult. The town needed to split into two. After agreeing on the new town site, often about seven miles away, everyone would go build the new buildings and homes regardless whether they were planning to move or not. They even made sure all the gardens were planted.

People would go back and forth between the new and old sites as they prepared the new town. They did not create winners and losers, where the winners stayed and the losers had to go off and fend for themselves and build a house alone. Instead, everyone took responsibility for their neighbors' wellbeing. Following the golden rule, each person treated the others the way they would want to be treated.

### More Beautiful Patterns

The more I read, the more I found stories of nations that currently or in the recent past seem like the Ashaninka in other ways too. Superficially they were different -- Eskimos in northern North America might have very different clothes, food, or ceremonies than the Gumbaynggirr of Australia, or the Jenu Kuruba in Asia -- but I kept noticing deep, beautiful patterns that they all share in common. 

Besides the lack of police and prisons, I also noticed observers remarking on their integrity. Ohiyesa was a Sioux man born in North America in the 1800s, and he visited an American city, he said, "I was cautioned against trusting strangers, and told that I must look out for pickpockets. Evidently there were some disadvantages connected with this mighty civilization, for we Indians seldom found it necessary to guard our possessions."

American S.M. Barrett described having complete trust in Apache leader Geronimo, saying, "When he once gives his word, nothing will turn him from fulfilling his promise." Stanley Vestal and George Grinnell described how they found the Sioux and Cheyenne people completely trustworthy, sounding just like my experience with the Ashaninka.

After returning to the United States, I wanted to connect more deeply with the Earth. I wanted to live like the Ashaninka and build a similar community with my friends.

I returned to the Appalachians, and a friend invited me to a very strange and magical place on the edge of North Carolina's Pisgah National Forest. Flowing water was safe to drink, and I drank straight from the stream as I had in the Amazon.

My new friends and neighbors taught me how to make herbal medicine, tan animal hides, and tell whether a dead animal was still safe to eat. I learned to cook over fire, preserve fruits and vegetables, identify wild edible plants, and preserve meat and fat, all without electricity.

I kept finding more stories of cultures that reminded me of the Ashaninka, such as the traditional Yequana, Apache, Haudenosaunee, Lakota, and others. These cultures have their differences, but they all live or lived in a beautiful way with each other and the Earth. I couldn't yet explain why, but these cultures all seemed healthy in a way that mine didn't.**

After a while, I realized that while I was having fun and learning useful skills, it wasn't enough. I still didn't feel very connected with the Earth. I wanted to go deeper.

I kept thinking back to a self-study program I had heard about called Kamana. The program promised to help people connect with the Earth using similar practices, stories, and attitudes as in many of the beautiful cultures I was reading about. The lead author, Jon Young, had received mentorship and guidance from sub-chief Jake Swamp of the Mohawks within the Haudenosaunee Confederacy, Ingwe who was raised by the Akamba people in Kenya, Gilbert Walking Bull and Tony Ten Fingers of the Lakota, and Tom Brown Jr who'd received extensive training from Stalking Wolf, an Apache man. The Kamana program seemed like a synthesis of what Jon Young had learned from people of all these cultures with the goal for the student to develop a deep, personal connection with the Earth.

That summer, I began the Kamana program.

### The First Core Spiritual Practice: Practical, Aware Gratitude

One early assignment involved finding a sit spot, a place I would go to every day, rain or shine. Instead of hiking all over and seeing many places for a few minutes each, I would spend hundreds of hours in a single location. Sometimes I would sit still, and sometimes I would walk around, noticing where my curiosity took me.

Often I fidgeted and my mind wandered. The Kamana program noted that many students have this trouble. I followed Jon Young's suggestion to "lose your mind and come to your senses."[xxx-kamana 2 nat|lose your mind] The more I paid attention to quiet sounds and subtle smells, the more my mind quieted, allowing me to notice all manner of birds singing around me, or an edible plant or animal trail I hadn't seen before.

All these things were around me the whole time. I just hadn't noticed before because I was in my head. It was a weird experience to suddenly notice everything that I had not seen, even though it was all happening right in front of me.

I also studied the Haudenosaunee's Thanksgiving Address that Mohawk man Jake Swamp had shared with Jon Young. Growing up in a Christian family, I was used to praying to God, but this Thanksgiving Address was very different. Instead of thanking God for the trees, I learned to thank the trees directly for their shade, food, firewood, and the good company they give. I learned to thank the water for quenching my thirst, the deer for their meat, and the birds for helping me become more aware of my surroundings. I gave thanks to the stars, sun, moon and wind.

Potawatomi woman Robin Kimmerer got to visit the Haudenosaunee when they gave this Thanksgiving Address. She described how it is part ecological lesson, part civics lesson, and partly a reminder to feel grateful for the gifts of life.[xxx-braiding sweetgrass|allegiance to gratitude]

For a long time, I really struggled with the Address. I felt anxious and bored. Unable to finish it, I would go to my sit spot and fidget.  Eventually I realized I didn't feel very grateful in general.  It took years before I could consistently find that place of gratitude and finish the Thanksgiving Address. Luckily, I discovered that gratitude can be practiced, just like bravery, patience and thoughtfulness.

Eventually I recognized the deep truth of the Thanksgiving Address. Everything is a divine being with sacred gifts to give. Trees give gifts of food and home-making material for humans and other animals. They hold the soil in place so it doesn't erode, and cast shade so the forest floor remains moist. Individual species give different gifts. Basswood trees give wood which is useful for starting fires easily, and oak trees give wood that allows fires to burn a long time which is useful for cooking dinner.

Just as each person is unique, I started to notice each tree and bird as its own individual being. I felt grateful to a particular chestnut tree for dropping an abundance of edible nuts, or a particular buckeye tree for stabilizing the edge of a stream where I liked to sit.

Nobody makes the sun shine, but it gives its warmth and light for free. I can plant an apple tree and water it and even pollinate it, but I cannot make it bear fruit. Apples are just an apple tree's gifts. I didn't make my mom nurture me as an infant, she just did. That was one of her sacred gifts. Rivers give us water for drinking and cleaning. Trees give firewood, building wood, food, and shelter for many critters. Animals give meat and if we watch carefully, they can alert us to what's happening all around.

That's all life is -- every being giving its gifts and receiving the gifts of others. And it's not just the Haudenosaunee who practice this gratitude for life's gifts. The Thanksgiving Address is unique to the Haudenosaunee, but developing deep gratitude is common in every healthy culture I've found.

Tom Brown Jr described how his Apache mentor Stalking Wolf helped him honor all the plants and animals as gifts from Creator, and to feel a deep sense of reverence as he practiced his survival skills.[xxx-the vision|p80] Okanaga woman Jeannette Armstrong described how they love other species as brothers and sisters.[xxx-original instructions|armstrong] Potawatomi woman Robin Kimmerer described how humans are the "younger brothers of Creation" and our older nonhuman siblings can teach many gifts of wisdom.[xxx-braiding sweetgrass|skywoman falling]

I'll never forget my first clear lesson from a nonhuman, a hunting lesson from red-shouldered hawks. I was walking through a forest and observed a single hawk flying and screeching overhead. Red-shouldered hawks like to hunt small animals like mice and shrews, so I knew they all would be acutely aware of the predator flying above. I assumed the hawk wasn't interested in hunting, since otherwise, why make so much noise?

I looked up through the forest canopy just in time to notice a second, silent hawk fly to the first one. Once they were together, the loud hawk flew in one direction screeching, and the silent hawk flew in the opposite direction. If I were a little mouse, I might feel relief at hearing the loud hawk fly away, and if I relaxed my guard I might not notice the silent hawk flying right over me! The hawks taught me a way to use deception while hunting. They also taught me to question my assumptions.

Every day I practiced developing this practical, aware gratitude for all the gifts I received from people and the nonhumans. Once I understood that all beings have sacred gifts to give -- that is, special ways they contribute to making life better -- that raised the obvious question: do individual humans have sacred gifts to give too?

### The Second Core Spiritual Practice: Giving My Sacred Gifts

I kept observing the birds and trees and other nonhumans around me, and I studied lots of field guides. I learned so many ways each creature contributes to the web of life, but I had never wondered what my contribution could be. No one had ever told me this before, but I learned that each human also has sacred gifts to give. It only makes sense, since we're divine creatures like everything else in Creation.

Once again, every single healthy culture I studied recognized this to be true. Tony Ten Fingers described a Lakota phrase, "mitakuye oyasin," loosely meaning "everything is my relative." Ten Fingers' elders also taught him a deeper meaning: "I have a burning desire in my heart to know how I fit into the Creation which is one living being."[xxx-kamana 3 nat|burning desire heart]

Each person has sacred gifts, a life purpose, a way they make the world a better place -- and only they can do it! All of Creation is simply divine creatures giving their gifts. That includes humans cultivating and giving our sacred gifts too. I believe that giving one's sacred gifts fully is how a person gives their deepest love. "Giving my sacred gifts" and "giving my deepest love" are the same thing. Thus, training a person to give their sacred gifts trains them to give their deepest love in life.

Some people have a special calling to enrich the soil, find food during lean times, or mentor children. Others are fighters who protect their people, or mediators who resolve conflict, or historians who keep ancient stories alive. I learned that it's up to each of us to find our sacred gift or gifts and our own unique way of making the world a better place. Ten Fingers also noted that it's each of our responsibility to help each other find their gifts, since sometimes a person can struggle to discover them on their own.

The Cherokee likewise see how important it is for people to help each other walk that sacred path, giving their divine gifts fully. Nancy Basket, a woman of Cherokee descent, described how traditional Cherokee recognized that they would keep reincarnating until everyone was living their purpose fully:

> Cherokee people anciently believed that we come back over and over again, like 144 times until everybody gets it right and nobody's left behind.

> Isn't that cool? ... Reincarnation until you achieve what you need to be doing. Each lifetime you come with a medicine, a purpose that only you can get done. If you don't get it done, it won't get done.

> That's how important each person is. What is it that you love to do?[xxx-basket interview]

Like the Thanksgiving Address and cultivating a practical, aware gratitude, I had a hard time with this practice too. I had never thought about my life purpose or what I deeply loved to do. In college, I wondered what sort of job I would most like, but I only considered decent-paying jobs that would let me have a life of safety and comfort. I never thought about what I would do or give if I didn't feel constrained by needing a job. When I thought about it, I mostly felt stressed or anxious.

Over several years, I sat with the stress and anxiety enough to notice that I actually felt angry. I felt angry that so many people, including me, are polluting the Earth. I felt angry with the sexism and racism around me, angry that prisons treat inmates so abusively, angry that politicians keep enriching the rich while so many people suffer. And I felt helpless to do anything about it, so every day I went through the little life I'd built trying to ignore an anger I didn't know how to channel productively.

Tony Ten Fingers noted that it can take years to recognize one's gifts and fully give them, especially in a culture that encourages people to walk a comfortable path, or live in a way that pays the most. But Tony Ten Fingers, Nancy Basket, and many others helped me get on the right path with the question: What do you love to do?

I knew I had a passion for learning and teaching self-defense even though I hadn't practiced in many years. While continuing with the nature connection training, I enrolled in jiu jitsu martial arts classes. It didn't address all my frustrations, but I knew I was on a good path, and I felt better.

I had found two big spiritual practices: a practical, aware gratitude for the gifts of others, and cultivating and giving my own sacred gifts.

I was fortunate to find the third core spiritual practice, one that tied them all together.

### The Third Core Spiritual Practice: Living in Reciprocity

Many healthy cultures like the Ashaninka, Lakota, Cherokee, Potawatomi, and Apache remain alive around the world, even if they're not all able to live in a fully traditional way still. At one point I noticed something interesting: they keep showing up in the news. Often when some environmental catastrophe occurs or a selfish corporation threatens to pollute the Earth, I notice people of healthy cultures standing in solidarity with the land.

The Sioux led the Dakota Access Pipeline protests in 2016 in North America, seeking to protect the water from oil spills.[xxx-cultural survival standing rock] In 2010, the Indian government evicted many Jenu Kuruba people from their ancestral land, supposedly to protect local populations of endangered tigers. The Jenu Kuruba noted that the tiger population was so high where they lived precisely because they worship the tigers, as well as the other nonhumans. The Jenu Kuruba demanded to return and that the Indian government stop giving mining companies leases on their homeland.[xxx-cnapa concept note]<sup>,</sup>[xxx-the best guardians of the forest]

In Africa, the Mbuti likewise rejected a government so-called "conservation" effort that tried to force them off the land even while companies came to dig for gold. One hunter named Mapenzi said, "We know how to protect our forest because nobody knows it the way we do. We know where the animals give birth, where they sleep and during which periods one must never kill them... The animals that the modern law wants to conserve are already under our customary protection. These are the laws our ancestors established."[xxx-guardian mbuti] The Gumbaynggirr in Australia and Sami in northern Europe work to prevent logging the old-growth forests.[xxx-australia example]<sup>,</sup>[xxx-resilience sami skerk]

In South America, the Yuracares, Tchimanes and other cultures work to prevent the destruction of their forests in the TIPNIS region of Bolivia, where the government wants to allow illegal road development, monocrop farming, and deforestation.[xxx-counterpunch tipnis] In northern Asia, the Evenk, Nivkh, and other cultures work to stop destructive Russian oil and gas extraction activities.[xxx-cultural survival sakhalin island]

Everywhere I looked, I noticed these cultures were standing in solidarity with the Earth, even putting their lives on the line if need be. Eventually I understood this as the third core spiritual practice: living in reciprocity. This means I have a responsibility to give back to all the beings who give so much to me. It is not merely a nice idea; it is a core practice for individuals and groups who take responsibility for giving back to all the beings who give humans so much.

In her book _Braiding Sweetgrass_, Robin Kimmerer noted how any culture of gratitude must incorporate reciprocity too, saying, "Each person, human or no, is bound to every other in a reciprocal relationship. Just as all beings have a duty to me, I have a duty to them." If I receive meat from an animal, I am bound to support the animal or its family. When I eat corn, I have a responsibility to take care of the soil it grows in. When I receive a river's gift of clear water, I am responsible for caring for the river. Kimmerer noted that learning and practicing these responsibilities is "an integral part of a human's education."[xxx-braiding sweetgrass|allegiance to gratitude]

I grew up Christian and then became atheist when I found that so many religious leaders fall short of the ideals they preach. But when I noticed people of all these beautiful cultures consistently putting their lives on the line to protect the land, to honor that responsibility for living in reciprocity, it showed me that they walk the walk. I believe this is normal in healthy cultures. This explains why the Western Shoshone man Corbin Harney said, "native people are not separate from the environment. We are the environment!"[xxx-original instructions|we are the environment] It also explains why Cherokee woman Rebecca Adamson said, "tribal people worship the sacredness of creation as a way of life, not as a philosophy or religion." She pointed out that no languages of healthy cultures even have words for religion. The nearest word for "belief" translates to "the way you live."[xxx-original instructions|first nations survival]

As a Christian, I grew up learning that pagans were bad or misguided people who worshiped false gods of the Earth. But Nancy Basket noted that "to worship" simply means "to respect."[xxx-basket interview] When the Jenu Kuruba said they worship the tigers, that means that they respect the tigers. Tigers are divine beings with sacred gifts, just like humans and trees and everyone else. I believe the Jenu Kuruba simply honor that each creature has a special purpose or sacred gift, a special role to play. The Jenu Kuruba live in a respectful way so that there is room for everybody, human and nonhuman.

I don't have any more insight about divinity than anyone else, but I know this: every single person has a voice in their heart that tells them how to walk a good path if only they'll listen. This is true whether a person is Muslim, Christian, Buddhist, atheist, pagan, or anything else.**

And it's not just humans who have an inner knowing. Every being has a special role to play in creation, and part of relating to life in a good way is learning how to respect not just ourselves and each other, but all the life around us. Christianity, Islam, Buddhism and other religions have aspects of these ancient understandings. I'm not interested in imposing a religion -- I just want to know, what are the core attitudes and practices I would need to embrace to live with other people and the Earth in a good way?**

### Solidarity Together
Even after visiting the Ashaninka, I didn't realize how beautiful life could be until I understood how people who base their lives on living in reciprocity also stand in solidarity with each other.

Nancy Basket described how, when traditional Cherokee towns got larger than 600-700 people, they became too big because hunting and foraging became difficult. The town needed to split into two. After agreeing on the new town site, often about seven miles away, everyone would go build the new buildings and homes regardless whether they were planning to move or not. They even made sure all the gardens were planted.[xxx-basket interview]

People would go back and forth between the new and old sites as they prepared the new town. They did not create winners and losers, where the winners stayed and the losers had to go off and fend for themselves. Instead, everyone took responsibility for their neighbors' wellbeing. Following the golden rule, each person treated the others the way they would want to be treated.

Okanagan Jeannette Armstrong grew up in British Columbia, Canada. She described the en'owkinwiwx collective decision-making process which explicitly includes several components: minority views, the land, human relationships, and creativity. She said that "the minority voice is the most important voice to consider... [it] expresses the things that are going wrong... if you ignore this minority voice it will create conflict in your community and this conflict is going to create a breakdown... This conflict will endanger... how we think of ourselves as a cooperative unit..., a unit that knows how to work together... and loves one another."[xxx-original instructions|armstrong]

Armstrong described how she was brought up as a _land speaker_, someone trained to speak on behalf of the land in their councils. They also have speakers for children, mothers, elders, water, and others. Armstrong described how she was "trained by my Elders to think about the land and to speak about the land." She does not represent people or consider herself an expert. Instead, "[I] must continuously be responsible to my community." Every time the community considers a decision, no matter how small, "my responsibility is to stand up and ask, How will it impact the land... our food... our water? How is it going to impact my children, my grandchildren, my great-grandchildren, what's the land going to look like in their time?"

When a community includes the perspectives of human relationships and the land in their decision-making, "community changes... the material things don't have a lot of meaning... material wealth and the securing of it or being fearful and being frightened about not having 'things' to sustain you, disappears... The realization that people and community are there to sustain you creates the most secure feeling in the world... When that happens, you're imbued with the hope that others surrounding you in your community can provide."

### Common Patterns

I kept finding example after example of entire cultures -- entire nations -- where people live or lived in beautiful ways with each other and the Earth, and all of them embraced these three core spiritual practices. They had plenty of differences, including their clothes, songs, language, diet, family relationships, and more. But once I saw these really deep common patterns across all the beautiful healthy cultures I studied, I wondered: are there other things they all have in common?

I'd only ever lived in capitalist countries, but I'd studied communism and socialism a lot too over the years. I started to wonder: what kind of economy do healthy cultures have?
