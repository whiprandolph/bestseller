## Whole Nations With Pervasive Generosity

The more stories I found of healthy cultures, the more I saw how generosity and reciprocity are or were a normal, default way of life. 

In the United States, any business needs to make a profit, and thus businesses are always trying to take more money than they give out (which is the definition of profit). This default, selfish desire to take as much as possible (ie to get rich) seems normal and pervasive where I live. But I kept finding stories of what life would be like if generosity were pervasive instead.

French missionaries noticed how, when a Huron home burned down, the victims' neighbors immediately contributed food and helped rebuild the lost home[xxx-duplicate story from chap 3]. Sioux parents gave many feasts to celebrate their children's developmental milestones, including their first step, first spoken word, first game killed, and so on, and at each feast they gave away as much as they could for the benefit of those who had little.

Sioux parents didn't just model generosity; they actively encouraged generosity in children from an early age. In one story, Red Cloud's band was going through a very hungry winter when his father finally hunted two elk. Little Red Cloud, all of 4 or 5 years old, went and invited all the old people to come get food -- without his parents' permission! His mother gave away almost all their food, and when little Red Cloud said he was hungry the next day, his mother did not admonish him. Instead she encouraged him to be brave as he faced the consequences of his generosity. She said, "Remember, my son, they went home singing praises in your name, not my name or your father's. You must be brave. You must live up to your reputation."

This generosity doesn't just exist between the people in these societies -- in every single beautiful culture I found, I noticed the generosity also extended to the nonhumans. That is, the people lived in a way that benefited the nonhumans around them. Endangered tigers in India have a very high population in the region where the Jenu Kuruba live, and the Jenu Kuruba say clearly that they worship the tigers as well as other nonhumans around them. The Mbuti of Africa carefully study each community of animals they hunt, so they know when and how to hunt respectfully to ensure those communities' survival. Stalking Wolf of the Apache in North America would seek out a small tree to harvest for a bow in a way that benefited the trees that were left behind.[xxx-NOTE: mbuti + jenu kuruba pieces may be duplicated from chap 3][xxx-note: apache bow may duplicate sacred responsibilities chapter]

These stories really touched me, but eventually I realized these kinds of stories are just normal in any society that encourages generosity and strongly discourages selfishness. The people serve each other and the Earth generously, and generosity is pervasive in all these societies, even extending to the leadership. They aren't necessarily generous to outsiders -- often they have been, and sometimes they haven't. But within the culture, they maintain generosity as a normal way of life.

I grew up in a Christian family, and I learned about Jesus Christ's extreme generosity. Well, it seemed extreme -- I actually believe that it would just be a normal level of generosity in these healthy cultures. Haudenosaunee writers, in their book _A Basic Call to Consciousness_, are very explicit that their leaders are "the poorest among us." While many kings and presidents seem to enrich themselves, these writers noted, "To become a political leader, a person is required to be a spiritual leader; and to become a spiritual leader, a person must be extraordinarily generous in terms of material goods."[xxx-NOTE: decide whether to refer to Mohawk or Haudenosaunee writers]

Growing up, I studied many different kinds of economy, whether communism in the Soviet Union, capitalism in the United States, or socialism in China. But at some level, all these kinds of economies encouraged selfishness. Whether it was American employees trying to maximize their wages or business owners trying to maximize profits, or Chinese farm brigades in the 1950s trying to maximize their work points, all these economies have encouraged people to produce as much as possible, either to get rich or to avoid poverty or punishment. How do healthy cultures ensure they avoid this sort of hurtful selfishness?

### Intentionally Avoiding Selfishness At All Costs

At first I wondered how a society could maintain that baseline of mutual respect. Was it chance? Were some societies just lucky, and others weren't? Eventually I learned that every healthy culture I've found recognizes that selfishness would be a tremendous threat if it were ever allowed to take hold, and they go to great lengths to help everyone feel comfortable with sharing generously.

In her book _Braiding Sweetgrass_, Potawatomi woman Robin Kimmerer describes how the traditional Potawatomi noticed when people behaved selfishly and helped them feel comfortable sharing again. If they refused to share, the Potawatomi first counseled them so they would feel comfortable sharing again, and then escalated to ostracizing and even banishing them if they insisted on acting greedily. Kimmerer wrote, "It is a terrible punishment to be banished from the web of reciprocity, with no one to share with you and no one for you to care for." After all, if some individuals began acting selfishy, others might feel the need to act selfishly to protect themselves, and soon selfishness might become pervasive in the society. And who would want to be in a culture with pervasive selfishness or greed? 

The traditional Haudenosaunee were likewise very aware of how terrible life would be if selfishness were allowed to take hold in their culture. They had no concept of private property, recognizing that embracing private property would turn their culture into a slave society -- just like any nation today that embraces private property. They even knew what kind of leaders would be chosen in any society that embraced private property and selfishness: "The acceptance of the idea of property would produce leaders whose functions would favor excluding people from access to property, and they would cease to perform their functions as leaders of our societies and distributors of goods."

In other words, in healthy cultures, it's no accident that they maintain a way of life based on generosity and mutual respect. In every healthy culture I've found, they recognize the threat that selfish behavior represents, and they go to great lengths to avoid it.

Okanagan woman Jeannette Armstrong described the traditional Okanagan decision-making process called en'owkinwiwx, and how it very carefully took into account the full range of the humans' and nonhumans' needs. Her description shows how beautiful life can be in cultures that embrace generosity, and why people would go to such great lengths to avoid selfishness. When a community includes the perspectives of human relationships and the land in their decision-making, "community changes... the material things don't have a lot of meaning... material wealth and the securing of it or being fearful and being frightened about not having 'things' to sustain you, disappears... The realization that people and community are there to sustain you creates the most secure feeling in the world... When that happens, you're imbued with the hope that others surrounding you in your community can provide."

### Why Doesn't Everybody Live Like This?

For years, I wondered what all these beautiful cultures have in common. In traditional stories from all these healthy cultures, just like I had seen with the Ashaninka, they seem to avoid crime without having any police or prisons. Integrity and generosity are pervasive, and they have leaders that people actually want to follow. It's normal for people to accept deep responsibility to treat each other and the Earth in a good way. Why do some cultures have these qualities, and others seem really unhealthy?

And what do all these unhealthy cultures have in common, with their racism, sexism, self-serving political leaders, pollution, and more?

Do cultures become unhealthy when the population gets too large? Some academic literature states that humans can only maintain tight knit communities of up to 150 people, a limit called "Dunbar's number." I commonly hear people claim that humans start behaving inappropriately towards each other in groups larger than 150, as accountability mechanisms supposedly start to break down then.

But that doesn't make sense. The Ashaninka number 2,000 and maintain a culture where everyone is treated respectfully. The Cherokee in 1674 CE numbered approximately 50,000 and likewise maintained that internal baseline of mutual respect amongst themselves.

Do cultures become unhealthy when they cover too much area? That doesn't make sense either. As of the early 1700s, the Haudenosaunee Confederacy covered over 38,000 square miles. This is comparable in size to Switzerland, Bhutan, or Taiwan. If the Haudenosaunee were a US state, it would be the 38th largest, between Kentucky and Indiana. Before extended European contact, the Cherokee covered approximately 40,000 sq miles. Clearly humans can maintain healthy cultures that cover huge distances and include many thousands of people.

Did the trouble happen when people started farming? No, the Huron gained about 75% of the food they ate from crops they grew. They still shocked French missionaries who couldn't understand how people could get along without police, prisons, and authorities imposing law and order. Even prior to contact with European colonizers, the Haudenosaunee relied more on farming than hunting for food.

Sometimes people of these cultures are called native, indigenous, tribal, indian, or first nations. I call them healthy human cultures. And I have found one root difference between healthy and unhealthy human cultures:

<center>__*In healthy cultures, everyone stands for a culture of mutual respect, and nobody rules over anybody else.*__</center>

In healthy cultures, everyone is expected to _uphold_ their law. In unhealthy cultures, people are expected to _obey_ the laws they're given, but they're punished for upholding the law -- after all, that is the police's job.

In healthy cultures, everyone stands for a culture of mutual respect, so they have strong leaders and no rulers and nobody imposes law on anybody else. Everyone agrees on their rules for appropriate behavior, and so they can live in a respectful way with each other and the Earth. And when someone behaves inappropriately, anyone may take initiative to ensure that the misbehaving person is held accountable. Such healthy cultures may fight with each other, but within the culture, they maintain a baseline of mutual respect.

In unhealthy human cultures, one person or a few people rule over everyone else. Whether the rulers are kings, billionaires, imams, priests, prime ministers, or presidents, they impose laws that everyone else must follow or face severe punishment. The rulers choose how to enforce the law, and forbid everybody else from taking initiative to hold misbehaving people accountable.

Another way of putting it is this: in unhealthy cultures, a small number of people trap a large number in exploitative relationships. Rulers use all manner of tricks, traps, and childhood training to convince everyone to accept the legitimacy of their rule. Other names for an unhealthy culture include "authoritarian culture," "unfree culture," "low-accountability culture" and "abusive culture."

Having rulers creates all the other problems that anybody can see. Racism, sexism, dishonest leadership, pollution, disconnection from nature, selfishness, widespread child abuse, forgetting, and poverty are all merely _common symptoms caused by the root cultural disease where some people rule over everyone else, and forbid people from standing for a respectful society_.

Rulers or ruling classes forbid people from upholding their own laws -- that is the police's job, though of course they have to follow orders too. Rulers forbid people from choosing their own laws -- that's the government's job. Every single culture where a person or group imposes law on the rest has sexism, racism, greed, poverty, and so many other troubles that seem to never go away. And none of these terrible things exist in the societies where everyone stands for what's right, and everyone agrees on the rules they will live by -- that is, in cultures without a ruling class imposing laws on the rest.

Why do rulers or ruling classes make it so hard to have an economy based on sharing? Why does every single nation with rulers have an economy that rewards selfishness, allowing people to profit from their neighbors and from exploiting the Earth?
