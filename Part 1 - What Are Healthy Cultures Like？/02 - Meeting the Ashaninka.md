## Meeting the Ashaninka

I used to work in the so-called "defense" industry (more accurately, the war industry). The more I realized how my job supported wars that do not make the country safer, the more I wanted to quit.

And in February 2014, I finally did. I had no idea how I would find a more meaningful and satisfying life, but I was ready to start figuring it out.

I started my journey already upset about so many problems -- pollution, poverty, dishonest politicians, wars based on lies, the rich getting richer, racism, sexism, and more. I was only beginning to understand how truly horrifying and insidious these cultural problems were, spanning around the world and across centuries.

I also had no idea where I might find a healthier, more caring culture -- someplace where a handful of powerful people did not dominate and exploit the rest.

Did such a place even exist?

A year earlier, I had met a woman at the Age of Limits conference who invited me to join a worktrade program at her shared home at a large intentional community deep in the beautiful Appalachian mountains of Western North Carolina. Could this be the sort of healthy culture I was looking for? I decided to find out.

At the community, I suddenly was surrounded by people willing to question conventional narratives and to live in alignment with their values. We might disagree about some things, but at least we could talk about our concerns. What a relief to feel so free! Whether or not this community was my final home, I knew I had made the right choice to embark on this journey.

At first, everything seemed great. I studied organic gardening and natural building. I worked in the village's dairy and gratefully attended the village council meetings as a silent observer. Over time, I made friends and got to know several village elders who had been in the community for a long time.

Much about life in the community felt satisfying. But after a few months, I started to notice that some things were not working so well.

Unfortunately, they unintentionally created a culture of haves and have-nots. The village had created its own currency. People could work to earn village money to pay village taxes or buy things from each other. This was a key part of their plan to create an independent village economy. However, one class of people were exempt from paying taxes and had an abundance of village currency while the rest were constantly looking for jobs serving the well-off so they could earn enough to pay taxes. People would fight over a job, not because they wanted to do the job, and not because the work necessarily needed to be done, but because they needed village money to pay village taxes.

I noticed that the have-nots seemed uncomfortable discussing their concerns with the haves. Instead, people just generally put up with it, sometimes selling food or handmade items to each other for money instead of freely sharing as they may otherwise have done.

I saw other problems too. When people acted or spoke without integrity, I commonly observed that others would simply ignore it or pretend it hadn't happened. Many long standing troubles never got resolved.

In late spring 2014, I had a private early-morning conversation with a village elder. By her third cup of tea, she opened up and told me something I'd never heard from her before. As the sun sparkled on the dew outside, she said she had lived there for almost 20 years and yet felt disappointed. She was unable to leave because she couldn't afford moving costs. She still loved the physical environment, but village life was not what she had envisioned when she arrived decades ago. Sadly, I heard similar disappointments from other elders, including some who had decided to leave the village.

This hit me very hard.

Such a beautiful community -- with hundreds of acres of land without debt, residents of all ages, ample space to garden and farm, clean water, streams and forests, and more -- was, unwittingly or not, actively reproducing aspects of the unhealthy American culture so many residents told me they wanted to escape.

Listening to these elders' private concerns, I imagined myself in their shoes, filled with the same "go for it" energy of the original founders. The idea of "build the path as you walk it" seemed deeply wise to me. I could imagine working with others to found a village someday. But what if I founded a village with a group of friends and we also unconsciously manifested the same unhealthy cultural patterns that cause so much harm?

How could I even know what unconscious patterns I had?

Though I had a lot to be grateful for at this village, this wasn't the healthy culture I wanted to learn from. I still wondered: do healthy cultures exist?

So I had a crazy idea. Instead of looking for a small village that was already part of an unhealthy culture like the United States, what if I looked for an entire nation of people that lived together in a beautiful way? I had just read _Black Elk Speaks_ and for the first time, I learned of the Lakota and how different their traditional way of life seemed compared to mine. I hadn't yet thought of the term "healthy culture," but in November 2014, I set off looking for one.

I spent almost a year searching for such a group in Ecuador, Bolivia, and Peru while studying Spanish intensively. I got robbed a few times and I almost died a few times. Once someone told me I would be killed if I kept searching, making a gesture of shooting me with blowdarts and my body then floating down the river. Along the way, friends joined me and left again, and I had various adventures, but through it all I was always looking for some entire culture living in a way I wanted to emulate.

By July 2015, I was worn out. I decided to rest and do an extended water-only fast in Satipo, Peru.  Eleven days into that fast, I finally gave up my search. Every hope had been followed by disappointment. I still wanted to find a healthy culture, but I had no ideas and no leads.

Exhausted, I had done my best and I had failed.

I felt a great relief. I imagined what else I could learn with the remaining time on my travel visa. That night, I fell into a more relaxed sleep than I had had in a long time.

The very next day however, I discovered I was wrong!

I met a tall thin Englishman named Mike, and we became quick friends. Each year for the last 35 years, Mike had been visiting a culture called the Ashaninka, and he had a profound respect for them. He invited very few people to join him on his visits. But when he realized that I would honor them too, he invited me to join, a gift for which I will forever feel grateful.

A few weeks later, Mike and his friend Jillian and I entered the first Ashaninkan village.

Before we got to the Ashaninkas' constellation of about a dozen villages containing 2,000 people, Mike told me two things I will always remember. Here is the first:

> _Bring them gifts. They are such kind and generous people that no matter how many gifts you bring them, you will wish you had brought more._

Mike was right. These loving people constantly shared their food without asking for anything in return. They taught me their language, how to spin cotton, and how to make friction fire. I danced with them, participated in ceremonies with them, laughed with them, sang with them, and played games with the adults and children. They gave me so much and were very welcoming.

Even though I rarely understood what they were saying, I have never felt so deeply comfortable and at home with anybody or any group in my entire life. This relaxation itself was an amazing gift. I couldn't believe it when one night, a group of ladies sat in a row singing and the men got up to dance. They invited me to join. Eventually the other men sat down again, and so I began to sit down. Then someone gestured that they liked my dancing, and they invited me to dance again. I said ok, and got back up, but no other men got up with me!

Growing up, I'd had lots of anxiety around dancing, but not around the Ashaninka. The women sang for me, and I danced for everybody, several times. I mostly didn't think, but when I did I just noticed my total lack of anxiety or concern. I felt comfortable and at home dancing in front of them in a way I had never felt before.

This sense of relaxed comfort was a recurring theme. One of my favorite memories is of an older woman spinning cotton into yarn on a drop spindle. I sat with a few other people on the edge of a clearing, and she sat on a handwoven mat on the ground by herself 10-20 yards away. At first she sat upright, rhythmically working the drop spindle. Over the course of perhaps an hour, I watched an amazing transition. After a while, she leaned over onto her elbow and worked the drop spindle from that position, and then leaned all the way over and took a nap with the spindle resting beside her. Eventually I glanced over again and saw her back in her original upright seated posture, working her spindle as she had at the start. She was the picture of relaxation the entire time.

I believe I witnessed a few things here:

* _Meaningful work_: Ashaninka women commonly wove this yarn into bags and clothing for each other and the men. She wasn't weaving for someone else (such as a boss) to make money to pay bills which would keep uncaring people away (such as tax collectors or landlords). I never got to interview her about this, but I believe the work was directly meaningful to her in a way that paid work often is not.

* _Satisfying rhythm_: She was free to work or rest as she decided. I've observed managers in the United States shame people for not being a "hard worker" and threatening to fire people who didn't work hard enough on the boss's schedule. And so I'll notice workers (including myself) will work when they really don't feel like it, or when they're sick. This woman's grace showed me what it would be like to work when it's time to work, and rest when it's time to rest, and find satisfaction throughout.

The children seemed very confident and capable, and one story from a little girl stood out. I wanted to learn to spin cotton into yarn, and I asked the woman I lived with if she would show me and let me learn with her cotton. She seemed a little skeptical. I only ever noticed women spinning yarn. When I asked again a few days later, my hostess brought me some cotton and a drop spindle. It took me a long time to make a strand longer than an inch! I later learned that cotton is one of the most challenging fibers to spin because the fiber length is so short. I started feeling frustrated as I eventually got strands of 2-3". I heard giggling nearby, and I noticed several little girls were laughing at me!

One of the girls, about 5-6 years old, came and took the spindle and cotton from me. With grace and confidence, she spun that cotton as if the drop spindle were an extension of her body. She looked at me and smiled and handed back the spindle and cotton, and then she ran away without saying a word.

I thought, "Wow, it's like she's been spinning her whole life!" Then I realized that was true. I had watched mothers spin with infant children on their laps, and so the little girls learned the motions even before they could lift a spindle. No wonder this girl was an expert at the age of six!

I never observed money exchanging hands while I was there. I heard from Mike and also saw signs that they had only recently encountered money at all, and most didn't seem to use money or have any. I never saw any transactions where people traded with each other. Instead, people just shared everywhere I went. It was common for the men to leave home each day to hunt, fish, or work in the large gardens. Women commonly stayed closer to home, often working together to weave mats, make food or drinks, care for the kids, or take care of other needs.  I never noticed any disrespect towards the women or any extra burden on them. Even though men and women seemed to contribute to their family and community in different ways, everybody seemed to have the same respect for each other.

Whenever guests came to visit, they would commonly sit in a circle on the ground and the woman of the household would bring out a large gourd full of peorentsi, a very pink and mildly alcoholic drink made from yuca and other root vegetables. Sitting on the liquid would be a smaller gourd they used as a cup.

My main host was a man in his early 20s named Andre. One day, we had planned to walk several miles to a village and he asked, "Would you like to go there directly, or would you like to take the long way and stop several times?" I asked to take the long way, and I'm glad I did. Every so often, the trail through the woods would open up into another household area and we would sit in a little clearing. Without any prior conversation, a woman would bring us a large gourd of peorentsi to drink. Sometimes we would talk, and sometimes we sat in silence. There was never any payment or trade. These women just shared with their guests as a normal practice. When we had rested enough and finished drinking, Andre and I would move on, only to find another home a little while later and repeat this again. I felt grateful every time for their warm welcome as if something miraculous had happened. They seemed to relate to this generosity like a normal thing.

They had a beautiful practice for sharing peorentsi. All the guests would sit in a circle on the ground, and the hostess would set the large gourd with peorentsi in front of somebody. It would only contain a single cup no matter how many people were present. By the time a woman gave me the drink one day, I knew what to do. I dipped the cup-gourd into the peorentsi and passed it to the person to my left. Then he passed it to the person to his left, till the cup traveled all the way around the circle. The last person would drink as much as they wished, then pass the cup all the way back around to me. Then I refilled the cup and passed it around, and the 2nd to last person would drink. Only after everyone had enough would I fill a cup for myself. It was the most social and connecting way of sharing a drink I had ever experienced.

When there were many men and women or many boys and girls, we would commonly break into two neighboring circles, one circle of men and one of women. I never saw anyone eat or drink alone though. If there were just one or two men or just one or two women, then we would all dine together in a mixed-sex circle.

Even their leaders surprised me. When we arrived at their most distant village, Andre introduced me to the village's leader. He was a very unassuming man, with a small frame and a very warm smile. This leader never told us any rules or gave any orders. He showed Mike, Jillian, and me where we could sleep, make a cooking fire, and poop. Once we had no more questions, he went to his home. I sadly never learned his name, but I learned a great deal by watching him.

This village leader did not seem at all different from anybody else.  His home was the same as everyone else's: a pavilion with 6 posts and a thatched roof. No homes in this village had walls. Some possessions like mats were kept on the ground, and items like fire making kits were kept tucked under the thatch in the roof. Thus I could tell that this village leader also did not have more possessions than anyone else; that is, he wasn't materially richer. He dressed the same as everyone else. He played games with other adults and children and me in a big clearing, including a big game of soccer one day with a ball of rags tightly wrapped in cordage. There was nothing imposing or threatening about him, so he wasn't a leader because he was a bully. Nor did he seem like a fool who was only a leader because of his possessions or parents. We never had any trouble, but I knew that if we did, I could bring it up and we would work through it. I felt just as comfortable around this leader as around everyone else.

In other words, he seemed like a normal man who took on extra responsibilities to help the village run smoothly but had no extra authority or power. Years later, I realized this was what it was like to have a community with strong leaders and no rulers.

I also had an amazing experience with water which started with a humble suggestion from one of my hosts: "would you like to go on a hike and see a special place?" After a steady walk through the rainforest, a group of 10-15 of us entered a clearing and I saw the most beautiful waterfall I'd ever seen. It fell down the side of a sheer cliff at least 40 feet high into a pond. On both sides, vibrant green moss shimmered under the water spray and golden sun.  I walked through the falling water to see the cliff while little children played in the pond. There was no trash, no graffiti, no concrete or safety railings, no sign that humans had ever been there except the little dirt walking trail we'd arrived on. The waterfall's majesty left a big mark on me. It also showed me that humans could honor such a beautiful place, essentially indefinitely.

The villages were very peaceful. I never saw any conflict or upset feelings, including among children. However, they were also very willing to use violence to protect themselves. I learned that the Peruvian drug wars in the 1980s had cost many Ashaninkans their lives. Several times when we walked between villages, young men brought along shotguns to protect the traveling group. I wished I could help them protect themselves somehow. At least I was able to buy them some shotgun shells from a distant market!

The whole time I stayed with them, they never asked me for anything. I never paid them anything, whether in money or bartered food or anything else, although I did share the food I brought in with me. But I sure felt a continuous desire to give back to them.

Luckily, I had trusted Mike when he said I would want to give them gifts. Before leaving Satipo, I'd asked Mike for a list of all the items the Ashaninka might value. I went to the market and filled a huge sack full of knives, fishing equipment, sewing equipment, cloth, food, and every other tool or material they might want. I was not going to show up unprepared!

And yet... Mike was right again. I still wished I had brought more. After a few weeks living inland, several men, women and children went with Mike and me back to the Ashaninka river-side village where we'd left our sacks of goods. Nobody counted time in hours or minutes there, so I don't know how long it took to give out everything. They smiled warmly and nodded as they pulled the gifts out of the bag. I could tell they approved and welcomed all the gifts even though there was little emotion and they did not say much. By then I was so used to non-verbal communication with them that I knew everything was going great. I felt sad when my sack was finally empty and I had no more gifts to give!

Even this experience amazed me though. There were about 2,000 Ashaninkan people spread over about a dozen villages. Some had never used money, and some sold cacao to traders at a river-side market. I estimated that the highest yearly income of any Ashaninka person was less than what I'd spent on the gifts in my bag. Yet my bag sat in a home with no doors or locks for weeks, even while I was multiple days' hikes away. When I returned, nothing was missing. The bag was untouched. Mike had told me these people were extremely honest, and I could trust them with anything. And he was right.

Mike had told me something else before we arrived at the Ashaninkas' villages:

> _You will spend the rest of your life figuring out lessons to learn from these people._

Mike was right about that too. A few months later, when I was talking with my father in Los Angeles, he asked me what I had learned. I teared up, as I still do today whenever I think about my time with the Ashaninka. I told my dad, "I don't know everything I learned. I'm still figuring it out. But I know this: people can live differently. We can treat each other well. I know it is possible, and I will never doubt it again because I saw it with my own eyes."

I knew humans could live in a healthy culture - the Ashaninka had proven it's possible! But what else could I learn? Did they just get lucky and stumble on a pleasant way of life by chance? Are there other cultures that live or lived in similarly beautiful ways that I could learn from?
