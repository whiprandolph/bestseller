## Chapter 2: Healthy Cultures Were the Norm for Millions of Years

My time with the Ashaninka felt shocking, but it turns out their generous and respectful way of life is not exceptional at all. Countless groups of people around the world, large and small, have lived with generosity and integrity towards each other for millions of years. Cooperation and mutual respect was -- and in a few places, still is -- the norm, not the exception.

What is not at all normal, in terms of our basic human nature, is how people live in the United States and every other unhealthy culture, past and present, that have dominated and warped people for millennia.

Because most people alive today have never experienced nation-wide generosity and respect, our dominant unhealthy cultures can seem quite normal to us.

But they are not.

### No Police, No Prisons, No Widespread Crime

One striking example of how different healthy cultures are compared to what we generally think of as 'normal' is their remarkable lack of prison, police, and crime.

Can you even imagine living in a nation without crime?

I was amazed to discover that the Ashaninka  had no police or prisons, yet they also seemed so relaxed and unconcerned about crime. There were no locked doors. In fact, they didn't have any doors!

Avoiding crime may seem impossible in societies numbering in the thousands or more, yet many large healthy human cultures have lived this way -- not just occasionally, but for millions of years.

Countless Americans and Europeans, when encountering healthy cultures for the first time, have been surprised by the lack of crime or law enforcement. For example, when French Christian missionaries first visited the Huron in North America in the 1600s, they were amazed that thousands of people could get along so well without police or prisons. 

In the 1930s, when American dentist Weston Price visited many healthy cultures around the world, he wrote that "few impressions can be more vivid than that of the absence of prisons and asylums." 

Benjamin Franklin seemed equally surprised by healthy cultures he visited in eastern North America in the 1700s: "All their government is by Counsel of the Sages. There is no Force; there are no Prisons, no officers to compel Obedience, or inflict Punishment."

In sharp contrast, the United States, France, and every other unhealthy culture around the world spend huge amounts of time, energy, and money trying to control crime with prisons and police -- and yet so much crime and political corruption continues.

How can some nations live without police and prisons, and also mostly avoid crime, while other nations, chock full of police and prisons, have so much crime?

It's not as if healthy cultures don't have some troubles -- in any society, people sometimes don't get along. The difference is that people of healthy cultures address disputes in ways that maintain a baseline of mutual respect among everybody, holding people to high standards of good behavior without demanding humiliation or submission. And when mutual respect is the norm, any selfish or hurtful act stands out as something to be immediately addressed so everyone can return to that respectful baseline.

Priscilla Settee, a woman of the Cree people, described their reconciliation process where elders would consider how to bring a person "back into a balanced life" and help them "focus on what is important in life." Instead of believing that a troubled person is bad and deserves punishment, this more loving approach recognizes that the troubled person is basically good but off-balanced or missing something important. The goal is to help them recover their balance.

The Ju/'hoan San (these punctuation symbols refer to sounds that donâ€™t exist in English) have healing dances for people who aren't getting along, where they "put these two people next to each other so that they can come into harmony by dancing together... it's a technology of opening the heart so that healing energy can enter and so that people's hearts will be revealed to each other and any problems or enmity will go out from between them."

Some people think these beautiful practices can only work in small groups, but these kinds of effective approaches have worked in both small and very large nations.

So what's the secret? How in the world do healthy cultures mostly avoid crime? Isn't selfish, violent, or otherwise bad behavior just an unfortunate part of human nature?

Actually, no. As later chapters show, when people live in respectful societies where everyone stands for what's right and gives generously as a normal way of life, the motivation to behave selfishly is greatly diminished.

And when trouble does arise, misbehaving people get counseled at first, and if necessary, the response escalates if the misbehavior continues. This gives people a chance to course-correct without the extreme stress, danger, isolation, and humiliation that comes from being imprisoned.

Traditional Potawatomi emphasized sharing and strongly discouraged selfishness. Potawatomi woman Robin Kimmerer explained how anyone who took too much, to the detriment of the community, was "first counseled, then ostracized, and if the greed continued, they were eventually banished..." 

Banishing or killing someone for severe misbehavior, like hoarding wealth or killing someone in anger, appears to have been very rare.

All these cultures seem so different, each with their own ways of helping people get along, resolving disputes, and addressing anybody's selfish or hurtful behavior. But one way or another, people of healthy cultures have or had ways of maintaining a baseline of mutual respect. That is, they found ways to maintain solidarity and respectful relations among everyone inside the culture as a normal way of life.

Of course, there are many stories of individual Americans or small groups pulling together in times of crisis or generally acting with kindness toward others. But a whole nation? Or even a whole town? Other than the Ashaninka, I personally have never seen a whole nation or a whole town of honest, giving, respectful people. Have you?

And yet as I read more about various healthy cultures, I kept finding stories in which whole towns and even whole nations routinely acted with kindness and respect toward every member.

Nancy Basket, a woman of Cherokee descent described how such kindness was maintained even as villages grew. When traditional Cherokee towns got larger than 600-700 people, hunting and foraging became difficult. Recognizing that the town needed to split into two, a new town site was agreed upon, often about seven miles away. They didn't have rich people and poor people, so that the poorest couldn't afford housing and had to leave or fend for themselves. Instead, everyone would go build the new homes and other structures regardless whether they were planning to live there or not. They even made sure all the gardens were planted.

People would go back and forth between the new and old sites as they prepared the new town. Everyone took responsibility for their neighbors' wellbeing. Following the golden rule, each person treated the others the way they would want to be treated.

### Protecting the Land

In every healthy culture I've found, in addition to standing in solidarity with each other, the people also stand in solidarity with the Earth. In other words, the people also stand for the needs of the nonhumans they live with.

The Sioux sought to protect the water from oil spills by leading the Dakota Access Pipeline protests in 2016 in North America. In 2010, the Indian government evicted many Jenu Kuruba people from their ancestral land, supposedly to protect local populations of endangered tigers. The Jenu Kuruba noted that the tiger population was so high where they lived precisely because they worship the tigers, as well as the other nonhumans. "To worship" means "to respect," so the Jenu Kuruba simply live in a way that respects the tigers. The Jenu Kuruba demanded to be allowed to return and that the Indian government stop giving mining companies leases on their homeland.

In Africa, the Mbuti likewise rejected a government so-called "conservation" effort that tried to force them off their land while companies came to dig for gold. One hunter named Mapenzi said, "We know how to protect our forest because nobody knows it the way we do. We know where the animals give birth, where they sleep and during which periods one must never kill them... The animals that the modern law wants to conserve are already under our customary protection. These are the laws our ancestors established." Stories from other nations in northern Asia, South America and around the world show whole nations of people similarly living in solidarity with each other and the Earth.

### Trustworthy and Generous

The more I read, the more I found stories of nations that currently or in the recent past were similar to the Ashaninka. Superficially, of course, they were and are different -- Eskimos in the arctic might have very different clothes, food, or ceremonies than the Gumbaynggirr of Australia, or the Jenu Kuruba in Asia. But I kept noticing deep, beautiful patterns that healthy cultures seem to all share in common when they are able to live in a traditional way.

Besides the lack of police and prisons, I also noticed observers remarking on their deep integrity. When Ohiyesa, a Sioux man born in North America in the 1800s, visited an American city, he said, "I was cautioned against trusting strangers, and told that I must look out for pickpockets. Evidently there were some disadvantages connected with this mighty civilization, for we Indians seldom found it necessary to guard our possessions."

American S.M. Barrett described having complete trust in Apache leader Geronimo, saying, "When he once gives his word, nothing will turn him from fulfilling his promise."

Stanley Vestal and George Grinnell also described how they found the Sioux and Cheyenne people completely trustworthy, sounding just like my experience with the Ashaninka.

I remember first reading about Geronimo's integrity, and my mind went to all the untrustworthy politicians in the United States -- but also every other country I'd visited, including Ecuador, Peru, Germany, Great Britain, Canada, and more. Some individuals in these countries are trustworthy, but none of these nations has anything like the universal integrity I'd experienced with the Ashaninka, or like these other observers in the 1800s experienced with the Sioux, Cheyenne, and many other beautiful cultures.

And it's not just trustworthiness. I kept finding stories of incredible generosity -- not just occasionally, but as a normal way of life for whole nations.

Jesuit Christian missionaries in the 1600s noted that the Huron would never let someone go without food or shelter. When someone's house burned down in the Huron village Ossossane, their neighbors came together to build them a new one. They did not have markets for trading or bartering, but instead embraced hospitality, gift-giving, and ceremonial exchanges. Visitors to a village were given food and shelter for as long as they wished to stay.

The Huron would publicly announce whenever someone donated a large amount towards a feast, funeral, or ceremony, and this raised the donor's status. People thus enjoyed accumulating goods so that they could give away as much as possible, and thus earn their neighbors' gratitude. Feasts were common as people sought to build up their stash of food only to give it away.

How amazing would it be to live in a society where people don't accumulate money to hoard it and enrich themselves, instead gathering wealth so they can give away as much as possible to their neighbors?

This wasn't unique to the Huron, and these practices aren't just from the ancient past. The Tzutujil Mayans were able to maintain their traditional way of life until about 1990, and MartÃ­n Prechtel described how they had a "self-impoverished theocracy" where people "loved to get more than someone else, just so they could dress fancily and give it all away to be big." Prechtel wrote how the Tzutujil Mayans became leaders: "To get anywhere in traditional Mayan society, you had to work really hard to get wealth, get appointed to office without campaigning, and then give it all away." Each time a leader rose to a new level in their hierarchy, he or she gave away all their things so that they were equally as impoverished as everyone else.

Haudenosaunee writers, in their book _A Basic Call to Consciousness_, described similar generosity in their traditional leaders: "To become a political leader, a person is required to be a spiritual leader; and to become a spiritual leader, a person must be extraordinarily generous in terms of material goods."

### When Even Prisoners of War Don't Want to Leave

All this could easily seem too good to be true, except for another kind of story I kept finding: stories of people born in unhealthy cultures running away to live in healthy cultures.

Benjamin Franklin also noticed this, pointing out how children born in healthy cultures and then raised in European cultures commonly tried to return to their healthy culture. However, "when white persons of either sex have been taken prisoners young by the Indians, and have lived a while among them, tho' ransomed by their Friends, and treated with all imaginable tenderness... yet [soon] they become disgusted with our manner of life... and take the first good Opportunity of escaping again into the Woods, from whence there is no reclaiming them." Many enslaved people who escaped British or American bondage also ran away to live with healthy cultures.

Even when people of unhealthy cultures were captured in war, they commonly liked living in a respectful society so much that they wanted to stay. When the French and Haudenosaunee Confederacy engaged in an exchange of war prisoners in 1699, Cadwallader Colden noted how the French prisoners didn't want to return home after experiencing life in a healthy culture: "...notwithstanding the French Commissioners took all the Pains possible to carry Home the French, that were Prisoners with the [Haudenosaunee], and they had full Liberty from the Indians, few of them could be persuaded to return."

In other words, French prisoners of war had lived in a non-abusive culture and liked it so much that few could be persuaded to go home. Colden noticed that this wasn't unique to the French, as "the English had as much Difficulty" and he wrote that this uneven prisoner exchange "has been found true on many other Occasions."

This was obviously humiliating for colonial leaders who pretended not to abusively exploit their citizens, but it got worse. In a big prisoner exchange on the Muskingum River in 1764, white people had won out against the local healthy cultures in war, but European leaders found the prisoner exchange unsatisfying. People of healthy cultures who had been trapped in European prisons ran back to their communities with great joy. But when "civilized" Europeans got a little taste of living in a society where integrity, sharing, and reciprocity were a way of life, many desperately wanted to stay.

In fact, many white captives had to be _dragged away with their hands and feet tied_ to keep them from running back to the healthy culture they'd been able to experience!

These healthy cultures were a major threat to colonial leaders, because their existence showed that it was possible to live in a respectful way, without a few people ruling over the rest, without rich and poor, and corruption, and all the injustices that unhealthy cultures always experience. This explains why many European colonial leaders deliberately spread lies and hateful propaganda, such as calling people of healthy cultures devil-worshippers and savages. Many colonial leaders in North America also punished anybody who tried to run away to live with nearby healthy cultures.

### Deep Respect, Even when Capturing Prisoners of War

For a while I wondered how healthy cultures could keep prisoners of war if they don't have prisons. I also had heard of healthy cultures killing their captives -- how does that square with being a culture based on generosity and integrity?

There are three ways to deal with captives that allow a nation to maintain a baseline of mutual respect: release the captive, kill them, or integrate them and treat them respectfully. 

People of healthy cultures have openly acknowledged that they treat their captives with respect, as that baseline of mutual respect really does apply to anyone within the culture. Sioux man Ohiyesa wrote, "It was a point of honor in the old days to treat a captive with kindness."

Pretty Shield, a woman of the Crow culture, described how even captive people were treated with the same decency as everyone else. When asked about captured women, she said, "because they were treated well they never tried to get away. They had the same rights as Crow women, and worked no harder." A Lakota woman named Good-trader was captured by the Crows and ended up having a loving family and later refused to return to the Lakota when she had the chance.

In this way, healthy cultures do not capture people and treat them abusively, which would create exploitative relationships within the nation. Even in the difficult situations created by war, healthy cultures ensure they keep that baseline of mutual respect.

All these stories showed me that the beauty of the Ashaninka isn't unique. Every culture is unique in its own ways, but there must be common patterns that allow people to live in nations that maintain a baseline of mutual respect. Different nations might do this in different ways, but all healthy cultures, one way or another, do or did somehow maintain a respectful way of life. People embrace integrity and generosity towards their neighbors, and have systems of conflict resolution that work while avoiding unaccountable police and punitive prisons. Because generosity was or is so common, they don't have rich and poor, and the leadership serves everyone instead of a few rich people.

Still... how do all these nations maintain such a beautiful way of life? And why are some cultures so unhealthy in comparison, with widespread greed, corruption, poverty, disconnection from nature, and untrustworthy behavior? If a group of people wanted to live in such a beautiful way, what lessons could they learn from the Ashaninka and all these other cultures to make that possible?
