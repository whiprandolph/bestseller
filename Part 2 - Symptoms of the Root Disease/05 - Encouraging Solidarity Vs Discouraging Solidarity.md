In every healthy culture I've found, elders consistently train children to be generous, and to see selfishness as a threat to their way of life.

Sioux man Sitting Bull said, "Love of possessions is a disease," and Sioux man Ohiyesa described his upbringing: "I was trained to be a warrior and a hunter, and not to care for money or possessions, but to be in the broadest sense a public servant." Potawatomi woman Robin Kimmerer described how traditional Potawatomi elders would tell their children scary stories of what might happen if they act selfishly, and if selfishness is allowed to take hold in their society.

When one or a few people act selfishly, the culture can respond and help them feel comfortable sharing again, or evict them if they insist on being selfish. But what happens when a ruling class exists, where a few people in a nation force laws on the rest and protect their wealth at all costs? Profit economies arise, creating widespread poverty and unnecessary suffering.

And what is the greatest threat to the wealth of the rich and powerful? The greatest threat to rich people's wealth, of course, is solidarity among the poor. Factory workers could just as easily run a factory without the owner taking all the profit. Landless peasants could easily have enough space for a home simply by taking unused land from the rich. Hungry people could easily eat well from excess food purchased by the rich.

What keeps all these things from happening? If oppressed people could recognize their situation clearly and stand in solidarity with each other, the rich could not stop them from redistributing enough wealth so that everyone would have enough, and seeking justice for all the abuse that always comes with exploitation of the poor.

The rich and powerful thus consistently recognize solidarity and generosity as a threat to their wealth and ability to continue exploiting the workers, and in every unhealthy culture they go to great lengths to sabotage solidarity.

### Sabotaging Solidarity in Unhealthy Cultures

Authorities and wealthy people sabotage solidarity in countless ways. Attacks on individual activists are the simplest to understand.

### Attacking Individuals

East German police developed a practice called _Zersetzung_ in German, meaning disintegration or decomposition. This police practice intended to cause activists to mentally, emotionally, and socially disintegrate without any explicit use of force. They might cause other government bureaucracies to lose citizens' forms, take longer than usual to respond to citizens' inquiries or requests, or otherwise seriously frustrate the lives of activists. East German police would sabotage people's reputation. They fabricated and circulated love letters or evidence of illegal behavior among an activist's friends and family in order to sabotage relationships, and they often succeeded.

They also surveilled activists to dig up and publicize any private behaviors they might want hidden, such as drug use or criminal records. They might make appointments or order goods in the activist's name. They would even manipulate a person's home, secretly entering and rearranging items like clothes and only removing things no burglar would snatch, such as a single piece of important mail. They might secretly damage a bike or car. Activists would start to doubt their memory and their ability to live a functional life. Police might cause strange noises on a phone line, repeatedly stop and search someone, and make conspicuous visits to the activist's workplace so coworkers would be aware of the police's interest. People's careers were ruined without them even understanding why. Zersetzung was gaslighting on a massive scale.

In another example of reputation sabotage, the US decided to have Julian Assange accused of sexual assault after Assange revealed huge numbers of war crimes and deceit by US political leaders. 

Authorities may audit the taxes of activists to force them to waste huge amounts of time. In 2022, American Matt Taibbi was busily exposing documents which showed how the US government pressured a social media company to censor content. Three weeks later, the US federal tax authority (IRS) opened an investigation of Taibbi. Fortunately powerful politicians contacted the IRS on Taibbi's behalf, and the IRS agents decided Taibbi didn't owe any taxes after all.

Murder is the firmest response authorities may take to suppress activism. One of the most famous examples in history is the Roman murder of Jesus Christ. He had consistently advocated breaking the law to feed and heal people who needed it, and he even attacked moneylenders for profiting in the Temple. He associated with many Zealots, known for resisting Roman rule, including having at least one Zealot among his disciples. Finally he was arrested and nailed to a cross and left to die in public. This was a common way for the government to kill revolutionaries in order to scare everyone else into submission.

The US government's killing of Martin Luther King Jr offers another example. King lead or supported many civil rights efforts in the United States in the 1950s and 1960s. Over time, he expanded his work over time to include anti-imperialism, even acknowledging the hypocrisy of the US attacking the Vietnamese while claiming to value democracy. 

On April 4, 1968, a sniper murdered Martin Luther King Jr.Â The government arrested and convicted James Earl Ray for this act, but a great deal of evidence indicated that someone else had actually killed Martin Luther King Jr.

In the following decades, activists were able to gather copious evidence that the US government had killed Martin Luther King Jr, and they presented their case at a civil trial in Memphis, Tennessee in 1999. Because they could not sue government officials directly, King's family sued a private citizen named Loyd Jowers as well as "Other Unknown Co-conspirators." Loyd Jowers had admitted he was involved in King's death, and these "unknown" co-conspirators were the police and intelligence agencies that couldn't be sued directly in court. The purpose of the trial was simply for the King family to publicly share evidence that the federal police and intelligence agencies had coordinated with local police to execute Martin Luther King Jr.27

Trial evidence showed that the defendant, Jowers, had said in a recorded meeting that he had helped plan King's death with the Memphis police department. Several witnesses testified that the sniper was on the ground, not in a balcony as the police claimed, and police never gathered these witnesses' testimony. The scope on the supposed murder weapon was not sighted, so as judge Joe Brown said, it "literally could not have hit the broadside of a barn." Also metallurgical tests indicated that the bullet which killed King had a different metallic composition than those in James Earl Ray's supposed murder weapon.

The civil trial court ruled in favor of the Kings, agreeing that the evidence indicated that Jowers and "Unknown Co-conspirators" had indeed killed Martin Luther King Jr.

Attacking and undermining individuals makes solidarity difficult, but authorities can also target activist groups and movements.

### Attacking Groups

The Nazis worked diligently to scare all Germans into submission. Bruce Bettelheim described how a group of activist lawyers objected to various Nazi policies, and so the German police arrested all the leaders.

This led to other group members believing they were safe as long as they stayed out of leadership positions. The Nazis did not want any public opposition, so they responded by arresting lawyers essentially randomly across the group. Nobody was explicitly told why they were arrested, but they all learned it was from their activism work. This scared everyone and allowed the Nazis to leave a few leading lawyers in place when they decided this was helpful to them.

Infiltration is particularly devious, where undercover police officers or contractors will pretend to be activists and participate in social movements. In 2011-2012, eight British women activists filed a lawsuit stating they were tricked into having long-term relationships with police who sabotaged their efforts to mitigate animal cruelty, reduce pollution, and more. Prosecutors and police chiefs set up 12 inquiries to investigate police misconduct, but all took place in secret and there has been no sign of change. Some of the women had even had children with the undercover police who had secretly worked to undermine all the good work they were doing.

The Tsarist Russian secret police provide more examples of police infiltration. Helpful informants were more likely to get into university or get a job, while incorruptible activists were denied. One police chief even allowed infiltrators to engage in illegal behavior to earn the trust of the real activists. Infiltrators were trained in all the fashionable revolutionary and socialist theories, and whenever an activist group seemed to settle on one theory, the infiltrators would start advocating for an opposing one, never letting the group settle on a coherent understanding of their problems and what to do about them. The manipulation ran deep!

These techniques are all devious, but they're still far from ideal for authorities. Ideally activists would never start their own activist groups, but join government-sponsored groups where they can be most easily surveilled and controlled.

### Astroturf Social Movements

Authorities may thus start their own _astroturf social movements_: groups that seem grassroots, but really are secretly controlled by wealthy or politically powerful people. In this pattern, activists join groups thinking that they are joining a real political movement, but the organization is secretly controlled by authorities from its founding. Activists can thus put in huge amounts of energy in an organization which is being continuously undermined by its own leaders, who do their best to ensure deep social change never happens.

Secret police in Tsarist Russia started trade unions that acted as if they were independent. Many thousands of workers joined, excited to be part of a movement for better wages, better working conditions, and more. S. V. Zubatov, one secret police chief, had the "movement leaders" host pro-monarchy classes. The union would pretend to negotiate with factory owners about wage increases, while the real wage negotiations were happening between the factory owners and the police chief. 

I believe a similar pattern is occuring in the United States as I write with the Black Lives Matter movement. As of 2024, the "impact" page on blacklivesmatter.com proclaimed "We are building an institution to fight white supremacy." The "about us" page on m4bl.org (Movement for Black Lives) stated "We are anti-capitalist." And yet the movement is heavily funded by some of the wealthiest white capitalists on the planet, including the people behind the Ford Foundation which donated over $800,000,000 to Black Lives Matter-related organizations.

The Ford Foundation is the "philanthropic" organization based on the wealth of white capitalist Henry Ford, founder of the Ford car company. Already by 1951 it had ties with the US Central Intelligence Agency, which requested its help doing psychological warfare operations in Asia. Ford Foundation directors have included some of the most politically connected white Americans, including John McCloy who also worked as president of the World bank, high commissioner for Occupied Germany after World War II, assistant secretary of war, and chairman of Chase Manhattan Bank. Other rich white donors to Black Lives Matter-related groups include Mark Zuckerberg (ceo of Facebook) and Pierre Omidyar (cofounder of eBay).

Astroturf social movements are simply a common pattern in unhealthy cultures where a few people control vast wealth and want to keep it at any cost.

## Healthy Cultures: When Solidarity is a Normal Way of Life

What is it like when solidarity is not blocked by selfish and powerful people, but just a normal way of life?
