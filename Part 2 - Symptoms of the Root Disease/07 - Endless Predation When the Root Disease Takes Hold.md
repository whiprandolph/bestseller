## Endless Predation When the Root Disease Takes Hold

Sioux man Sitting Bull said, "The life of white men is slavery. They are prisoners in their towns or farms." At first this seemed like an exaggeration. How can even middle-class people be prisoners?

Well, just as prisoners have no influence over how the prison rules are enforced, the vast majority of people in any unhealthy culture have no influence over how the laws are enforced. And just as prisoners have little influence on what happens in the cell across the hall, the vast majority of citizens have little influence over what happens around them. And when huge numbers of people resign themselves to tolerating predatory behavior instead of standing for what's right, abuse and exploitation become extremely common.

Child sexual abuse runs rampant in these settings. Researchers in Germany, Ireland, the USA and Ireland have investigated Catholic priests for child abuse and found many thousands of victims just from Catholic priests in each country. One investigation just in France found over 216,000 child sexual assault victims between 1950-2020. Universally, investigators found higher Catholic Church authorities covering up or stalling investigations into the abusive priests.

Child rape can become quite normalized. One boy was raped by monks in Buddhist Tibet and complained to other monks. He said, "they shrugged and said simply that that was just the way things were."

Many secular authority figures have also raped children, and few have faced any accountability at all -- clearly too few to deter any others. Famous British media personality Jimmy Savile raped dozens of underaged people as young as 8 years old from the 1960s-1980s, and British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) staff evicted young women who complained of his inappropriate behavior from the premesis. An orphanage in Portugal was revealed to house a huge child sexual abuse operation in 2002, although the police and the Portuguese president were notified of the abuses by several boys in 1980. Several low-ranking men were prosecuted, but none of the wealthy international clients who flew in to spend time with the boys were prosecuted, and of course the police and politicians who failed to investigate likewise went unpunished.

In the late 1980s in Omaha Nebraska, a child sexual abuse operation was discovered based in the child foster care system in the United States. The US has had two presidents named George Bush, and I commonly hear that the elder Bush was the better president and statesman. He was also head of the central intelligence agency and vice president, making him one of the most powerful people in the country in the 1980s and early 1990s. Investigators also found child sexual abuse victims who clearly named him as an abuser, among many others including local judges, politicians, and business executives. 15 knowledgable people were died violent deaths during the investigation which significantly hampered it, and none of the perpetrators faced punishment.

Nothing occurred in any of these cases to suggest that the institutionalized child sexual abuse ever ended. As far as I can tell, people in all these countries go on about their lives as if this rampant child sexual abuse isn't still happening all around them.

Other kinds of predation are common, with different kinds more or less common in different unhealthy cultures. 

Reports from France, USSR, USA and Great Britain all indicate that the governments knowingly exposed their own soldiers and sailors to nuclear weapon radiation without their consent. Decades after scientists had established the harmful effects of radiation, the Soviet Union, United States, France, and Great Britain all knowingly exposed their soldiers to nuclear radiation to study the effects of fighting around atomic bombs. Reports from all these countries show that soldiers were expected to remain silent, even as they were left to face terrible injuries, and even as their children were born with deformities that were clearly traceable to radiation poisoning. Soldiers widely understood the risks as well. One French soldier said, "we knew these things," but authorities demanded that soldiers "obey and shut up."

A staggering level of abusive and exploitative behavior always occurs when people allow themselves to be ruled, and all these things will continue till people can generate healthy cultures again, where everyone stands for what's right, and nobody rules over anybody else.

### Healthy Cultures Don't Have Child Sexual Abuse

A few years ago, as I was re-reading the book _Daughters of Copper Woman_, I noticed something that astounded me. I was reading the story of the Nootkas' first contact with Spanish conquistadors, which included Catholic priests. The Nootka noticed that they "never saw any of the Keestadore [conquistador] women, they only brought men and young boys who got used as women whether they liked it or not." Even in their first interaction with Europeans centuries ago, they noticed regular child rape that remains so common in unhealthy cultures to this day. After a period of uneasy interactions, the Spaniards kidnapped, raped, and murdered two Nootka girls of about 10 years old, leaving their bodies on the beach for their relatives to find. This part did not astound me, as I'd read this sort of story about Catholic, Buddhist, and other authorities many times.

What did surprise me was the Nootkas' response. As I interpret their story, they had never before encountered child sexual assault:

> "...The people had no way of understandin' what had happened. There'd never been anythin' like this in all the time since the beginning of life, and so they could only stare at the proof of horror and feel numb shock. They could see what had been done, but they couldn't understand how, or why. It had been hard enough to believe the Keestadores [Spanish Conquistadors] would force a grown woman to have sex when they didn't want, but the thought of sex with a child was just too horrible for the people to even imagine, so they didn't know what to think.

> The old woman examined both the babies, and it was as if the sure evidence of what she found shook the centrepost of all creation, and threatened the here and now as well as the past and future..."

The Nootka didn't just have less child sexual assault than my unhealthy culture, or stronger laws against it, or better ways of healing trauma, or better self-defense classes for girls and women. I believe they straight-up didn't have _any_ child sexual assault. The possibility that a child might be raped had not occurred to them until they encountered an unhealthy culture.

This passage was transformative for me. It showed me that healthy cultures and unhealthy cultures really are different.

I knew child rape was bad, but why was it so bad that it would "[shake] the centrepost of all creation" and "[threaten] the here and now as well as the past and future?"

Healthy cultures see any disrespect as a cultural wound that affects everybody, and I believe that the Nootka recognized that this child rape was a severe disrespect and therefore a severe cultural wound. If this disrespect wasn't fully addressed, everything was at risk, and nothing would be safe.

The Nootka soon allied with neighboring groups and successfully killed all of these conquistadors. They saw how important it was to their culture's survival to protect themselves from predators.

This taught me the importance of maintaining that internal baseline of mutual respect. Once a culture allows disrespect and tolerates predators, there is no end to the trouble.

### Non-Predatory Leadership is Unstable in Unhealthy Cultures

Of course, not all authority figures engage in predatory behavior or serve the rich. Some leaders, such as Jacobo √Årbenz in Guatemala or Salvador Allende in Chile implemented policies that benefited the poor at the expense of the rich. And both were taken out in coups by high-ranking military and business officials.

Why is it so hard in unhealthy cultures to get leaders elected who actually seek to serve all the people, including the poor? And why are they so quickly replaced when they do get to power?

Healthy cultures and unhealthy cultures are both stable. In healthy cultures, when everyone stands for what's right and generosity is the norm, the people wouldn't tolerate a selfish leader, and he or she is quickly replaced.

When people learn not to stand for what's right in unhealthy cultures, and the economy rewards selfishness so that there are a few rich and many poor, the rich wouldn't tolerate a generous leader who might threaten their wealth and privilege, and they'd be sacked.

This shows clearly the path to living in a society with true servant-leaders: create a culture where everyone stands for what's right, and no one rules over anyone else.
