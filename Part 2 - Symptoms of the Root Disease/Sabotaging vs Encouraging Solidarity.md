## Sabotaging Vs Encouraging Solidarity

Human cultures are living organisms. Like lions, trees, ant colonies, and other organisms, when human cultures get wounded, they try to heal.

Any act of disrespect between two people is a cultural wound. Healthy cultures respond to disrespect by addressing it and finding a way back to that baseline of mutual respect. This is what it means for people to take responsibility for each other and the culture's wellbeing: instead of ignoring or excusing the hurtful behavior, they address the issue. Cultural healing occurs when people address disrespect so that it stops happening.

Priscilla Settee, a woman of the Cree people, described their reconciliation process where elders would consider how to bring a person "back into a balanced life" and help them "focus on what is important in life." Instead of believing that a troubled person is bad and deserves punishment, this more loving approach recognizes that the troubled person is basically good but off-balanced or missing something important. The goal is to help them recover their balance.

Megan Biesele and Ju/'hoan San man Kxao =Oma (these punctuation symbols refer to sounds that don't exist in English) described the Ju/'hoan San healing dances where "they try to put these two people next to each other so that they can come into harmony by dancing together... What people have told me about what's going on in these beautiful dances is that it's a technology of opening the heart so that healing energy can enter and so that people's hearts will be revealed to each other and any problems or enmity will go out from between them."

Even more serious injury or even accidental killing can be resolved in a way that is satisfying to everyone involved.

There's a trouble though! In unhealthy cultures where a few people rule over the rest, they block the cultural healing.
