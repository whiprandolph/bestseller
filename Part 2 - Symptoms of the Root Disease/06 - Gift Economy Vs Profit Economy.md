## Chapter 6: Gift Economy Vs Profit Economy

In every healthy culture I've found, elders consistently train children to be generous, and to see selfishness as a threat to their way of life.

Sioux man Sitting Bull said, "Love of possessions is a disease," and Sioux man Ohiyesa described his upbringing: "I was trained to be a warrior and a hunter, and not to care for money or possessions, but to be in the broadest sense a public servant." Potawatomi woman Robin Kimmerer described how traditional Potawatomi elders would tell their children scary stories of what might happen if they act selfishly, and if selfishness were allowed to take hold in their society.

When one or a few people act selfishly, the culture can respond and help them feel comfortable sharing again, or evict them if they insist on being selfish. But what happens when a ruling class exists, where a few people in a nation force laws on the rest, protect their wealth at all costs, and forbid people from standing for what's right?

In other words, what happens if selfishness is allowed to fester, and a nation of people cannot maintain a way of life based on sharing? 

Tragically, selfish ruling classes consistently impose a way of life that rewards selfishness, creating a _profit economy_. Profit economies motivate individuals to try to get more than they give, training people to profit from their neighbors. Profit economies _move resources to people who already have them_. In these economies, the more resources a person has, the more additional resources they are able to get.

Capitalism, socialism, and communism are all examples of profit economies. The main difference is simply whether wealthy individuals control most property (capitalism) or whether the government controls a larger share (socialism and communism).

I recognize two major kinds of profit economy: market economies and command economies. Most unhealthy cultures have some mix of these.

Command economies are simple: an authority figure gives an order, and a trapped person obeys the order or gets severely punished. Militaries, chattel slave plantations, and prisons are all command economies. Workers don't choose their bosses, and if workers choose not to work, they receive direct, severe abuse.

In market economies, workers can often choose their boss and even their type of job. Anybody has the choice not to work. But unless they are independently wealthy, people who don't work for money face poverty, social isolation, shame, and worse. Whereas the fear of physical punishment motivates workers in command economies, the fear of poverty motivates compliance in market economies.

In market economies, people are trapped in financial desperation so that they constantly need to work a job in order to survive, and saving enough to avoid financial desperation is very difficult.

Many Americans in 2025 recognize chattel slave plantations or forced prison labor as forms of slavery, but in the 1800s, wage jobs were also known as "wage slavery." Any form of coerced labor is slavery, and wage slavery has major advantages for ruling classes.

* _Advantage 1: Market economies are self-organizing slave societies_. Market economies are slave societies because they're based on coerced labor, keeping people in financial desperation and forcing them to find any paid work to survive. They are self-organizing because administrators do not need to order individual workers to do specific jobs. Workers will actively look for jobs, and if none are available, they may seek out training or move to other regions where there's work. Entrepreneurs will seek out business opportunities to try and get rich. All these people are trying to find ways to work for money, meaning everyone ultimately serves the people with the money: the rich and the government which is the source of most money in the first place.

* _Advantage 2: Politicians and businessmen can pretend that workers live in a free society_. Workers can legally choose their job and where to live. This offers much more flexibility than in chattel, prison, or military slavery, and so politicians can pretend that wage slaves live in a free country, and they should be proud and grateful.

Soviet East German minister for state security Erich Milke once said, "The [German Democratic Republic] is a state that guarantees its citizens freedom, democracy, and basic human rights." On Human Rights Day, Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau noted that, "defending human rights and democracy has always been, and will continue to be, a priority for Canada..." Whether socialist or capitalist, these are simply different forms of market economy that allow politicians to pretend that the workers are free.

People of healthy cultures -- who currently or in recent times lived in actual freedom -- recognize the truth. Sitting Bull said "The life of white men is slavery. They are prisoners in their towns and farms." When people are forced to work for others to survive, not allowed to choose their own laws, and not allowed to uphold the laws they obey, widespread selfishness results, and that's what a slave society looks like.

### Maintaining Financial Desperation

Authorities use a vast number of techniques to make people feel financially desperate -- that is, make people desperate to earn money. As a result, many people sacrifice their integrity, health, family time, and other important things just to keep the job they need to survive. This financial desperation explains the famous quote from Upton Sinclair: "It is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends upon his not understanding it."

Without a job, workers may not be able to pay for housing, food, or health care for their family. Inflation continuously saps the value of previous savings, meaning the money instantly becomes less valuable starting the moment it's earned. Even relatively well-paid workers may fear not having enough money for retirement, unexpectedly losing a job, or having a health crisis, and thus even well-off people can feel financially desperate as well.

Banks and landlords regulate the prices of houses and apartments, calculating the proportion of people's monthly income that they can afford to pay in mortgage or rent. This debt-to-income ratio means house prices and rental prices always increase at least as much as people's wages, keeping workers from "getting ahead." Property taxes force homeowners to pay money to keep the house they already own.

Authorities may make the drawbacks of poverty arbitrarily terrible, including putting poor people in prison, shaming poor people, forcing poor people to eat less nutritious food, taking away poor people's children when they struggle to provide a safe, clean home.

Authorities may allow crime and drugs in the poor parts of town, allow the police to mistreat poor people in a variety of ways, underfund schools in the poor districts, and allow factory pollution to be worse in poor areas.

The financial desperation that powers most market economies also compels poor people to fight the wars of the rich. In unhealthy cultures around the world, plenty of people join the police or military as a way to escape poverty or dangerous neighborhoods.

Prison labor also keeps wages low and workers desperate, as prisoners can be forced to do work for pennies per hour. Just as chattel slavery kept wages low in the Americas for centuries, prison slave-labor keeps wages low in many countries today.

Of course, rulers may not need to force bankers, politicians, individual bosses, and business executives to all play their part. All they need to do is create an economy that systematically rewards selfishness, and the people who cultivate selfishness will inevitably take these roles and get rich, playing their part in maintaining their profit economy.

Authorities' underlying attitude in market economies is "find a way to serve us, or enjoy your poverty." Workers don't legally have to have a job, but they face desperate poverty if they don't find a way to serve some master somewhere. However, the worst punishment for disobedience is usually just being fired. In command economies, the attitude is simpler: "Obey my order, or I will punish you." Workers in these situations generally do not choose their boss and are physically punished if they do not follow orders.

For example, in US chattel slavery before the US Civil War, if a slave did not pick enough cotton in a day, the boss would whip them severely to motivate higher performance the next day. Prisoners likewise do not get to choose their boss or their kind of work, and plenty of stories from the United States, Russia, and other countries describe severe physical and sexual punishments for prisoners that disobey orders.

Militaries are command economies as well. When there is a draft, governments force people to join the military. Even when people volunteer, militaries commonly do not let soldiers leave at will for years after joining. Soldiers commonly don't choose their boss (commanding officer) and are imprisoned if they disobey orders.

Whether the workers are trying to avoid punishment or poverty, or the leaders are trying to get rich, every role helps reinforce the profit economy that ultimately generates wealth for the ruling class. What would it be like to live in a nation without selfishness, where sharing was rewarded instead of profiting?

### Gift Economies Generate and Spread Abundance
Gift economies reward sharing. They ensure everyone is taken care of, moving resources to where they're most needed or where they serve the greatest good. 

I experienced a gift economy among the Ashaninka where sharing was the norm. Plenty of other people living in other healthy cultures, past and present, show that this is not particularly unusual.

Nancy Basket, a woman of Cherokee descent, summarized the traditional Cherokee culture of sharing this way: "If we all had a lot, then everybody had a lot. If there wasn't a whole lot, then no one had a whole lot."

Sioux man Ohiyesa described the Sioux culture of sharing when he wrote, "During the summer, when Nature is at her best, and provides abundantly for the [indian], it seems to me that no life is happier than his! Food is free -- lodging free -- everything free! All were alike rich in the summer, and, again, all were alike poor in the winter and early spring."

Amazingly, when people born into profit economies encounter people born into gift economies, they can each get offended at the other! How is that possible?

#### Gift Economies and Indian Givers

One of my earliest childhood memories involves giving somebody a gift and noticing that they didn't use it. When I tried to take it back, I was called an "indian giver." I was told that to be a generous gift-giver, I was supposed to release all interest in what happens to my gift after I give it. I was told that the gift becomes someone else's property and therefore is no longer any of my business.

Not wanting the scorn I associated with being called an indian giver, that's how I learned to give gifts -- first it belonged to me, and now it belongs to someone else.  It took decades for me to learn that this attitude towards sharing is rooted in private property ownership and essential to maintaining authoritarian cultures. I was amazed to learn that my early childhood self had the healthier attitude to gift-giving!

All of life is simply divine beings giving their gifts. This is the recognition behind the first core spiritual practice of cultivating the practical, aware gratitude for the gifts of life. Chestnut trees give tasty chestnuts, stinging nettle plants heal joint pain, stars provide guidance, and the soil accepts us back and recycles us after we die. All these beings give divine gifts that make life possible and beautiful. No one makes them do this. Humans play their role by giving their own sacred gifts too -- the second core spiritual practice.

In gift economies, people simply figure out where gifts are most needed or valued, and everyone helps circulate gifts until they get to that highest use. This is where the derogatory phrase "indian giver" comes from: people of North American healthy cultures (known as indians) often gave gifts to European colonists, noticed they weren't being used, and thus asked for them back so the gifts could be given elsewhere. European colonists thus saw "indian giving" as a violation of their private property rights.

Nancy Basket described how the Cherokee would commonly ensure gifts got where they were needed, and how European colonists misunderstood this: "We would know each other well enough to see what they might need. And if we would give somebody a gift and they didn't use it, we would be embarrassed. And we would either take it back or something else because it wasn't being used. She didn't need it. And people called us Indian givers for that."

"Indian giver" became a negative label, describing someone who gave a gift and now selfishly wants it back. In reality, an "indian giver" is behaving thoughtfully, paying attention to whether the gift is needed. If the gift goes unused, the so-called indian giver exerts extra effort to retrieve the unused item and pass it along to someone else who needs it more.

Due to this fundamental difference between caring for others and caring primarily for oneself, the contrast between these two economies is striking. Gift-economy practices can seem offensive to people in profit economies, and profit-economy practices can seem offensive to people in gift economies!

A person in a gift economy may feel upset if a person accepts a gift, doesn't use it, and then refuses to pass it on to someone else. A person from a profit economy may feel upset if they receive a gift only to find that the giver wants it back. Both sides may feel offended, and it reflects a fundamentally different perspective on sharing (and trusting others to share) versus hoarding (and not trusting others to share). Do gifts keep moving until they arrive where they are most needed? Or do people hoard possessions whether they need them or not?

Potawatomi woman Robin Kimmerer noted the consequences when she wrote, "If all the world is a commodity, how poor we grow. When all the world is a gift in motion, how wealthy we become."

This healthy-culture attitude to gift-giving stems from the deep recognition that all of life is simply the giving of divine gifts. Every spider, bear, bush, and cloud is giving its sacred gifts and somehow contributing to the web of life. Who would want to stop all that giving? Gift economies aim to circulate gifts rather than hoard them, and this kind of human economy fits in well with the larger nonhuman economy of all life.

Gift economies also have many practical benefits. They move resources from the haves to the have-nots, minimizing inequality. Gift economies ensure neighbors take care of each other. People might suffer poverty together occasionally, but nobody suffers poverty alone while others have abundance. Gift economies help people take care of each other whenever the group faces a big challenge.

In nations that expect everybody to stand for what's right, this is the way of life that results -- a life of shared abundance. As Okanagan woman Jeannette Armstrong said, "The realization that people and community are there to sustain you creates the most secure feeling in the world..." In cultures that forbid people from standing for what's right and upholding their own laws -- because that is supposedly the police's job -- profit economies result, with a few people becoming extremely wealthy, and the rest trying to survive and get as comfortable as possible in their unhealthy culture. Widespread selfishness is the result.

But it doesn't have to be this way. Individuals and whole nations are capable of incredible generosity when everyone stands for what's right, and nobody rules over anybody else.

#### Solidarity and Generosity Used to be Universal

A few thousand years ago, every human alive lived in a healthy culture where solidarity and widespread generosity among neighbors was simply normal and expected. Since then, unhealthy cultures have formed and slowly spread around the world, trapping free people in exploitative societies where a few people rule over the rest. How have rulers trained conquered people not to have the personal strength to stand for what's right, instead tolerating endless exploitation, discrimination, pollution, and corruption? And how do healthy cultures train people instead to have that deep personal strength to stand for what's right at any cost?
