Growing up in the United States, I heard a lot of people say that peace is good, and violence is bad.

### Selfish Violence

* Rulers spreading hate towards peace activists
    * Present-day example: calling peace activists “putin lovers” 
* Wars based on lies / false flag attacks (ie 9/11, Nazi attack on Reichstag, etc)

### Violence-in-Service

Stories of collective self-defense show how people can use violence responsibly, in service of the community instead of selfishly. 





* Vs sacred circles: Apache collective self defense, CONAIE, black activists
* Zapatistas
