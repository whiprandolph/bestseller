## Chapter 7: The Source of Racism and Hatred, And How to Live Without Them

Remember that old story "The Emperor's New Clothes"?

A con man tricks an emperor into believing that he is dressed in beautiful, expensive clothing when, in fact, he is wearing nothing at all. Afraid to be called a fool by this very confident man, the emperor pretends that he really is wearing beautiful clothing, and his close officials go along with it. The emperor then goes out among the public stark naked, and the masses of people pretend to admire his fine clothing. Everybody maintains this pretense until a child blurts out that the emperor is stark naked.

Why would all the adults pretend to believe an obvious falsehood? When I first found this story as a child, it seemed silly! Eventually I learned that this story actually explains one of the major drivers of racism and hatred in the world, including major events currently happening in the news.

So what does The Emperor's New Clothes have to teach about ignorance, racism, and hatred happening right now?

In this story, the emperor is the ruler, meaning he decides on the laws and how they're enforced, and he can punish people who express beliefs that he doesn't like. The people in this story know that, and know that it is safer to believe that he is beautifully addressed, or at least pretend. After all, acknowledging the truth could lead to imprisonment or worse.

It's simply a common pattern in unhealthy cultures for unaccountable authorities to punish people for saying uncomfortable truths, and I believe this pattern will continue until we can generate healthy cultures again.

Let's look at some historical examples to see how this works.

In the US pre-Civil War south, slavery was assumed to be good for the slaves by all right-thinking people. Doctors even had a diagnosis called "Draepetomania" where any slave who tried to escape was believed to have a mental illness! Why would they believe such nonsense, even highly trained doctors, instead of simply recognizing the evils of slavery and acknowledging people's healthy desire to escape?

The answer is simple: any white Americans who sympathized with black people and acknowledged the evils of slavery were heavily punished. In the slave states, people could be imprisoned for 10 years for having a copy of _Uncle Tom's Cabin_, a book that showed slavery in a sympathetic light. Draepetomania represents what I call a _blind belief_ where people believe something because authorities make it the safe or convenient thing to believe, not because it's true. In other words, it was safe for doctors to believe the runaway slaves had mental illnesses, and it was unsafe to see runaways as healthy and slavery as evil.

Likewise in the Soviet Union and China in the mid 20th century, the government and society were assumed to be great and getting better, so any activists who fought corruption were assumed to have mental illnesses as well. Many activists were arrested and accused of having mental disturbances and sent to prison hospitals where they were treated like the political prisoners they were. These activists were behaving appropriately and trying to serve their people, and authorities made up theories of mental illness as a cover story to justify imprisoning them.

In this social pattern, authorities punish people for speaking the truth, making it safe and socially acceptable to believe falsehoods. Unfortunately, this can also cause huge amounts of racism and hatred in a society, as people are encouraged to adopt racist or hateful attitudes, and those who don't are punished.

The Ku Klux Klan was a campaign of paramilitary violence operated by wealthy ex-slaveowners in the US South after the US Civil War. Most Americans know that this violence was directed at black people to scare them into remaining second class citizens. But few know that this campaign also attacked any white people who sympathized with those black people!

In other words, whites who were racist were left alone or even rewarded. Any anti-racist white people risked rape, murder, having their house burned, or other atrocities. I believe this is a major driver of anti-black racism in the US South: authorities wanted that racism to avoid solidarity among poor white and black people, and for centuries they brutally punished any white people who tried to stand for what's right. Many KKK members were sheriffs and politicians, so the law was part of the problem!

Similar stories abound from unhealthy cultures around the world. Nazi Germans and Soviet citizens were each trained by their governments to hate the other side during World War II. Anyone who didn't hate enough risked being called a sympathizer and traitor and going to jail. When these authorities wanted war, they propagated hatred among the populace and punished anyone who spoke the truth and refused to hate.

Why did so many Germans learn to hate Jewish people after World War I? Well, the German monarchy, business leaders, and generals had really screwed up and lost the war. Knowing it was a foregone conclusion, they surrendered before the enemy had crossed into German territory. Unfortunately, they had lied to the German public, and the media contained propaganda which said they were winning the war until the moment they surrendered. Thus many Germans were really confused: why did they surrender if they were winning?

The political, military and business leaders wanted to avoid accountability for losing the war and spreading lies, so they propagated a "stab-in-the-back" narrative, blaming Jews, labor activists, liberals, and others for undermining the country from within.

A tragic number of Germans believed this nonsense, and it wasn't an accident: propagating hate and ignorance towards Jews and activists and blaming them for Germany's WWI defeat was just a way for the ruling class to avoid accountability. Tragically this was one step on the road to the Holocaust a few years later.

Racism, hatred, and ignorance can thus be widely propagated by authorities to avoid accountability, sabotage solidarity, promote imperial wars, and other reasons. It is confusing to discuss because authorities will punish someone for one secret reason, but publicly accuse them of something different. For example, a Nazi German peace activist may have tried to convince his neighbors that avoiding war would be better for the country, but he'd be arrested and accused of spreading Soviet propaganda and undermining the army. The activist was only trying to speak the truth or share a perspective in service of his people, but he was punished and accused of something different.

I kept finding examples like this, where people are punished for speaking the truth, or punished for not being racist or hateful as authorities expect. And the more I encountered this pattern, the more I saw it play out right in front of me in the news.

For example, as I write in 2025, the United States is supporting Israel in its genocide of the Palestinians. Israel has occupied Palestine for decades, keeping Palestinians under intense surveillance. The control was so tight that even many years ago the Israelis were literally counting the calories of food being allowed in to keep the Palestinians at starvation levels.

The Israelis began the genocide in October 2023, with tremendous US support in the form of weapons, surveillance, fuel, political cover at the United Nations, and more. But just how bad has the violence been? Many news stories say that only 40-50,000 Palestinians have died -- surely a tragedy, but not a genocide.

Before the present conflict started in October 2023, the Palestinian population was estimated at 2.2 million. When US president Trump took office, he stated the Palestinian population as around 1.7-1.8 million.[1] Other estimates confirm this, using normal techniques to estimate military+civilian casualties in war. So between October 2023 and February 2025, Israelis had killed ~400,000-500,000 people through military violence, famine, disease, and so on while extremely few Israelis have died in comparison.

How have the Israeli and American governments trained their populations to tolerate and even support this genocide? You guessed it: spreading racist and hateful propaganda towards Palestinians, and punishing anyone who tried to speak the truth and stand up for what's right.

Many government statements have called the Palestinians subhumans who deserve immense cruelty. For example, Israel's defense minister Yoav Gallant said, "We are fighting human animals and we are acting accordingly." Israelis were trained to see Palestinians as a threat on par with Nazi Germany, rather than victims of a cruel occupation.

In Israel, one school girl expressed sympathy with the Palestinians, saying she hoped they could return to their homes soon. She was suspended from school as other students threatened to burn her house down and the Ministry of Education accused her of "incitement against IDF [Israeli] soldiers."

In America, we see similar disturbances. Anyone who tries to acknowledge the truth about Israeli aggression towards Palestinians is accused of antisemitism. President Trump is deporting many people for attending what he calls "illegal" protests and he accuses universities of tolerating antisemitism for allowing protests against the genocide. This is only an expansion of the policy that his predecessor president Biden started, as the genocide clearly has support from both major political parties.

And it's not just the government that tries to scare protesters away from acknowledging the truth: many business leaders want to scare people into submission too. One businessman, Kevin O'Leary, went on television and said all activists were being monitored with AI-enabled cameras, and their protesting would be recorded and show up in background checks, and they would never be hired again! In fact, North Carolina outlawed wearing face masks outside just to make this surveillance easier.

Just like American slave owners scared poor and middle class white people into hating black people or remaining silent so they wouldn't oppose slavery, modern day authorities are trying to scare us into submission so we won't oppose their genocide.

Why are Israeli and American governments and corporate leaders supporting this genocide? People can only speculate: is it part of a plan for creating a major new west-Asian trade route through Israel? Accessing gas deposits off the Gaza coast? Developing beachfront real estate? All the above, or something else? When leaders are unaccountable, it can be difficult to know why they behave as they do.

So let's take stock: the protests are appropriate, the Israeli genocide against Palestine is real, and it's not antisemitic to point these things out. But a strong coalition of American and Israeli business and political leaders have decided to support this genocide, and they're punishing people for standing for what's right by accusing them of antisemitism and using this as a cover story to justify punishing them.

This shows how ancient patterns of nations with rulers (or ruling classes) are playing out right now. America may not have a king, but anytime one person or a group can impose law on the rest, and choose how that law is enforced, you wind up with the same kind of tyranny. This is predictable in any society where people are punished for upholding their own law (because that's supposedly the police's job, but of course they have to just follow orders). Ancient Rome, Germany, the Soviet Union, Israel, Canada, communist China, the capitalist United States -- all of them have shown this pattern where unaccountable leaders punish truth-tellers and propagate racism and hatred when it suits them. All these countries are actually dictatorships: cultures where some people dictate the law, and everyone else is expected to obey it.

This isn't the only dynamic that leads to racism and hate in unhealthy cultures, but it is sadly common. When people are trapped with selfish and unaccountable leaders, the results are always tragic. What would it take for a group of people to select the most selfless and honest leaders instead?

### Gracious Receiving: How People Can Choose Leaders that Actually Serve the People

These stories of selfish rulers contrast vividly with countless stories of generous servant-leaders of healthy cultures. The Haudenosaunee describe how, when they were able to live in a fully traditional way, their spiritual leaders were their political leaders, and to become a spiritual leader a person had to give away huge amounts of material goods. In other words, their leaders were the most generous, and this is true in every healthy culture I've studied.

What is it about healthy cultures that allows them to have selfless, generous servant-leaders? Do they just vote every few years and complain about politicians between elections? Do they believe that "god" chose their leader, and despite the endless corruption, do they have "faith" that "god's will" is being carried out? Or is there a responsibility people could take to ensure that only the most selfless people become leaders?

The Tzutujil Mayans were able to maintain their traditional way of life until about 1990, and Martín Prechtel described how their leaders gave away their wealth each time they reached a new level of leadership, putting them on the same level as everyone else -- and these leaders were expected to _never campaign for office_. Likewise, traditional Cheyenne warriors were trained from childhood never to brag about their moments of bravery, instead trusting that other warriors would tell their stories on their behalf.

It turns out, it's everyone's responsibility to notice people's good deeds and retell their stories so that people's reputation can grow without any campaigning or bragging. 

If you want to be able to live in a healthy culture, with leaders who serve the people instead of selfishly serving themselves, _notice other people's good deeds and tell their stories_. This is based on that first core spiritual practice of practical, aware gratitude for the gifts of others. Each good deed is a gift, and one way to receive that gift graciously is to tell the story so that others know.

When you notice someone who consistently tells the truth even when they could get away with lying, let the person know that you see them, and when appropriate, tell the stories to other people. When someone keeps a promise even when they really don't feel like it, tell the story. When someone consistently shows up to meetings early and well-prepared and helps the group make good decisions, tell those stories. When someone is a source of calm and good humor in difficult moments, or gives generously when they think no one's looking -- _tell those stories_ so that the person's reputation grows.

This is how a group can select the most humble, generous, honest, and capable leaders, including people who would never campaign for a leadership role. When everyone in a culture practices noticing good deeds and retelling the stories, the reputations of the best leader-candidates grow naturally. When it's time to pick a leader, the people will know who it should be.

Given that some healthy cultures have had many tens of thousands of people, and spanned up to 40,000 sq. miles or more, this practice doesn't just work at the village level, but can help nations of any size choose the best people at each level of leadership.

I love telling stories of others' good deeds -- it's fun! Who doesn't like telling and hearing good news? Who doesn't like encouraging and rewarding good behavior? Every retelling is a little celebration.

One Nootka storyteller described the importance of "the mirror in the eyes of the people you love." When someone feels unseen and unappreciated, it can be discouraging. When people know that their neighbors and coworkers see them and feel grateful for their good deeds, they're likely to do more good deeds in the future. It simply feels good to give to grateful people. 

This is the power of that practical, aware gratitude to encourage more good behavior in the world, and every single person has this power. What good deeds have you witnessed recently? And to whom could you share the happy stories of these good deeds?
