## Phone Script:
Hi, I'm Whip Randolph. Last July I asked for copyright permission to use an image in a book, and I wonder if I could request permission to use that image in a 2nd book.

May I send you an email today with the request and get a response to have it in writing?

## Email

Hello Mr. Cornelius,

I contacted you in an email last July requesting copyright permission to reproduce an image in a book. 

The image showed a row of riot police on the article entitled "Pulaski native Dalton's KSP Post 11 riot squad helps in Louisville" from June 9, 2020.

I am publishing a second book and would like to use the image again. May I have permission to use the image for the life of the book and related versions or editions, for worldwide release and any translations?

Thank you,
William "Whip" Randolph
