### Rear Cover

There are whole nations, today and in recent times, where people live respectfully with each other and the Earth. They have leaders people trust, no rich and poor, and no discrimination. Integrity and generosity are common.

Many nations, like the United States, Ecuador, or China have similar problems like corruption, discrimination, and needless poverty. These troubles persist no matter how people vote.

What will it take to make integrity, awareness, and generosity pervasive, so people can trust their neighbors and leaders?

It will take _The Deepest Revolution._ Based on the words of people of healthy nations, this book is _not_ theoretical. If you're tired of endless political and cultural problems, and you're ready for deep change with strong and caring people, this book is for you.

### Notes - Cindy call 7.26.25

* internal vs external freedom
* we don't have that external freedom. People who do call us all slaves.
* you may have internal freedom, where you give your deepest love in each moment. But most also don't have internal freedom, where we learn to hold ourselves back, or just focus on ourselves and not think about others, or ignore injustice. 
* have choices, but not choices that matter
* repeat definition of freedom throughout part 1 and part 2
* despite external troubles, we can have internal freedom and courage to do what's right, and work with others to eventually build a society with that external freedom
* becomes strand throughout - 


* even if you're wealthy you're insecure - you know if you lose your wealth, no one will give a shit about you. 
* everyone is insecure - even rich. Because if you lose it, you're f'd.
* not just insecure about people not having your back, you're insecure about all the ways you could lose it.

* internal freedom to give our deepest love, and external freedom to do it in a society that welcomes it

### Final Reminders
* make sure chap 6 images, captions, and lead-ins are all on the same page and formatting is nice
* make sure all _ and * and ** become bold/underlined
* remove all ** edit marks
* make all riot police images the same size
* rename ODOC Zap chapter? would they have said it was successful at any time? Or not humble/too triumphant?
* verify capitalization of god/God at each point: God when it's a meaningful reference, "god" when people are having "faith" in bullshit
* verify part/chapter formatting is correct in epub, esp preface material and post-material
* Chapter number fixup: Scan for "Chapter" and verify all references are correct, including within a couple chapters
* make sure there aren't any pages with just 2-5 lines. Word-craft as needed.
* scan for 'integrity of service' and ensure any explanations are after definition
* A few places where I end statements with "and more" or "countless others" - can seem ambiguous, making expanding on this with more specific statements would be more strong, "plenty of "and so on"
* scan for common phrases and ensure they're not repeated too close to each other.
  * healthy nation
  * unhealthy nation
  * stand for what's right
  * seek justice

"Many healthy nations referenced in this book have not been able to maintain a traditional way of life since being conquered by unhealthy nations in recent centuries. However, unlike people who've forgotten their healthy-culture ancestors, they still remember..."

### Cindy's -- Can We Really Transform Our Unhealthy Culture?

Given the extent of the core problem in unhealthy nations (a few ruling over the many), the challenge of creating and maintaining a healthy nation is mammoth. 

But here’s the good news: creating a health culture is doable! If it wasn’t doable, why were millions of people over millions of years able to do it? 

Healthy nations represent who we really are. We don’t have to reinvent ourselves, we simply have to return to who we really are.

So, where do we begin? Like Jesus and so many others have shown again and again, we begin with ourselves. Many of this book’s earlier chapters offer ideas about what we can do on our own. The next step is building our collective spiritual strength with other people.

Building with other people will not be an easy path because, just like myself and probably just like you, those of us raised from birth in unhealthy nations have unwittingly absorbed many of its abuses along the way. 

Even those of us who have worked on our own spiritual and personal growth still live our lives to various degrees embedded in the broader dominant unhealthy nation where we continue to need to fend for ourselves, sometimes at the expense of others, whether we like it or not.

So I am not saying that change will be easy. I am saying we can.  And I am saying we should.

### Early Reader Feedback

#### Bob

##### Part 1 - 7.9.25 call

* Overall impressions
  - makes me want to get back to the big book
  - really good
  - on a big level: does a really good job painting the big picture, saying what's wrong, what needs to be done to make a healthy nation
    - people need to do lots of work to grow after growing up in unhealthy nation w/racism, sexism etc
    - bringing up NVC
    - interested in getting into detail more
    - paints accurate, really good picture about what's unhealthy
    - process of changing society and myself - very important component of "what to do with this information" - expects that's coming up, excited to dig deeper into "what to do"

* Anything you disagree with, or find suspicious
  - "whole nations can live without them" - reacted to this; "who we really are, what human nature is - more broadly defined, 2 years olds go through period of discovering self, get me-oriented till parents help them" - thinks we have all those parts, if we do have human nature, it's malleable and includes everything we see in history
    - addressed this in part 1 well, but reacted to my saying that "exploitation etc is not part of human nature" - my sense of human nature is that it is, and it's our job to figure out what to develop, what to set aside

  - healthy nations shared are mostly historic, but how to live this way is much more complex now w/all the bullshit forced on us now by mainstream culture
  - hard to read these examples -- that's not my life, my cultuer is way more complex.
    - don't know a way around this.
    - understood the European-prisoner part

  - I am emotionally struck that cultures that have been healthy historically are not extant, haven't dealt with what we've dealt with and "come out the other side"
    --> give example in part 1 of Zapatistas going from unhealthy -> healthy, releasing sexism --> shows that people can pull out of shitty cultural patterns, and that this isn't just historical but is happening now

* Any parts you specially liked, found surprising or interesting

  - having gone through court system - comment about 98% of prisoners not getting fair trial stood out; "Very potent, very powerful" - didn't realize that was true.
  - liked 3 core spiritual practices - hit home for me - already aware of gratitude part, has daily meditation; sacred gifts & reciprocity are work he can do - he's introverted and can focus on himself, could focus on giving his gifts and reciprocity more

* Any parts that seemed slow or tedious? Any parts where you felt like putting the book down?

  - this shorter version is terrific, not long-winded, not repetitive
  - read part 1 three times
  - fact that concepts are clear, examples illuminate that - very strong part of this shortened version
  - thinking back to big book - was a positive - very engaging, but a massive amount of reading; fact that he agreed with everything, some of the new-to-him details are stimulating

* Are you curious to read part 2?

  - absolutely
  - questions we've been discussing in this call - I want to read on, hard to dissect part 1 on this call knowing part 2/3 are coming
  - "I'm excited about it"

* other feedback

  - Big "YES" - all these cultures seem so different, each with their own ways, but one way or another have or had ways of maintaining baseline of mutual respect... "YES, ABSOLUTELY"
    - not all perfect, but have baseline people agree on
    - work with people as stuff shows up
    - solidarity, respectful baseline allows culture to have normal healthy framework within which things are resolved

### Old Notes
* open with Ashaninka piece?
  * still immersive, first-hand, no/minimal theorizing

* Can condense many chapters into brief sections full of assertions w/sample stories
  * Realized recently... many chapters actually boil down to same thing "believe this / act this way or be punished" - blind beliefs, imposing sexism/racism/hatred

* change framing: transformation rather than healing. The US or Russia aren't going to be healed, but transformation is possible, especially in a region

Major themes
  * my Ashaninka experience
    * establishes my credibility, makes it palpable and alive now for the reader
  * Three Core Spiritual Practices
  * generosity vs selfishness
    * gift economies
  * Personal experience of rulers
    * solidarity outlawed - it's not ok to stand for what's right when someone's attacked; only the police are allowed to enforce the law
    * have leaders whom you may not trust to care about your needs - leaders unaccountable
  * Positive training
    * Integrity (three integrities)
    * Bravery
    * Remembering (healthy nations exist, what is actual freedom like?)
    * Awareness
  * Negative training
    * trained not to know healthy nations exist
    * trained to tolerate abuse
     * ignoring abuse
     * hurtful character traits: cowardice, ignorance, reality-avoidance, selfishness, forgetting (healthy nation ancestry), shame, pleasure-rejection, distrust, etc.
    * trained for division and distrust

Recognizing Manipulation As It's Happening

  Condensed:
    (rulers impose, people obey or they are punished)
    * profit economies (systemic selfishness)
    * racism (systemic discrimination)
    * sexism (systemic sexism)
    * hate (systemic hate)
    * blind beliefs 1+2

Chapters to keep almost entirely
* 1, 2, 9, sacred circles, 

* incorporate healthy nation-qualities in subcultures: rainbow, children

Themes
* Healthy nations exist - here's what they're like
* personal qualities to cultivate to create one
* unhealthy nations
  * what to be able to watch out for (noticing manipulation, not falling for it)
  * things are actually this bad - needs change, worth big risk
  * healthy nation commentary on unhealthy nations (ie Sitting Bull speech)

more stories of gift economies in unhealthy nations - think of cardboard boxes with veggies in rural wnc

#### How can I tell if I'm in a healthy nation or not? 
* Do my neighbors expect me to stand in solidarity with people when they're threatened? Or am I punished for this, because it is supposedly the police's job?
* Is selfishness or greed common, or rare?
* Do I trust leaders to put the needs of the group ahead of their own needs, no matter what? Do I trust the leaders to consistently tell the truth and keep their   promises?


##  notes 5.15.25

* put economics as second part 2 chapter


part 2
1. same as current
2. economy
3. combine heart-opening/closing + racism/hatred
4. combine solidarity / violence-in-service/selfishness

* mention assymetric prison exchanges - early and late in book?


Start all part 2 chapters with healthy nations?
Endless predation - lightbulb moment leading into part 3
  * our politics aren't working. Right/left, democracy-monarchy, capitalism-communism - these arguments aren't working. 
  * trained to hold back/shut down self - endless predation is what happens, what we can easily predict will happen


## research notes

### Quran

Like Basket/MLK, this quran quote (Al-Quran Surah 5: Verse 32):  On the other hand, if one saves the life of a single person it shall be as if he has saved the lives of all mankind

### some of us remember it

One Nootka storyteller described the importance of remembering these kinds of stories and wisdom. She said their secrets were "proof there is another way [to live], a better way, and some of us remember it."[xxx-daughters copper woman|p146]

### Big picture view

* Big picture view:
  * traditional times
  * crisis but still sovereign and healthy
  * conquered but maintain traditions best they can
  * healthy nation forgotten
