### Old Notes
* open with Ashaninka piece?
  * still immersive, first-hand, no/minimal theorizing

* Can condense many chapters into brief sections full of assertions w/sample stories
  * Realized recently... many chapters actually boil down to same thing "believe this / act this way or be punished" - blind beliefs, imposing sexism/racism/hatred

* change framing: transformation rather than healing. The US or Russia aren't going to be healed, but transformation is possible, especially in a region

Major themes
  * my Ashaninka experience
    * establishes my credibility, makes it palpable and alive now for the reader
  * Three Core Spiritual Practices
  * generosity vs selfishness
    * gift economies
  * Personal experience of rulers
    * solidarity outlawed - it's not ok to stand for what's right when someone's attacked; only the police are allowed to enforce the law
    * have leaders whom you may not trust to care about your needs - leaders unaccountable
  * Positive training
    * Integrity (three integrities)
    * Bravery
    * Remembering (healthy cultures exist, what is actual freedom like?)
    * Awareness
  * Negative training
    * trained not to know healthy cultures exist
    * trained to tolerate abuse
     * ignoring abuse
     * hurtful character traits: cowardice, ignorance, reality-avoidance, selfishness, forgetting (healthy culture ancestry), shame, pleasure-rejection, distrust, etc.
    * trained for division and distrust

Recognizing Manipulation As It's Happening

  Condensed:
    (rulers impose, people obey or they are punished)
    * profit economies (systemic selfishness)
    * racism (systemic discrimination)
    * sexism (systemic sexism)
    * hate (systemic hate)
    * blind beliefs 1+2

Chapters to keep almost entirely
* 1, 2, 9, sacred circles, 

* incorporate healthy culture-qualities in subcultures: rainbow, children

Themes
* Healthy cultures exist - here's what they're like
* personal qualities to cultivate to create one
* unhealthy cultures
  * what to be able to watch out for (noticing manipulation, not falling for it)
  * things are actually this bad - needs change, worth big risk
  * healthy culture commentary on unhealthy cultures (ie Sitting Bull speech)

more stories of gift economies in unhealthy cultures - think of cardboard boxes with veggies in rural wnc

#### How can I tell if I'm in a healthy culture or not? 
* Do my neighbors expect me to stand in solidarity with people when they're threatened? Or am I punished for this, because it is supposedly the police's job?
* Is selfishness or greed common, or rare?
* Do I trust leaders to put the needs of the group ahead of their own needs, no matter what? Do I trust the leaders to consistently tell the truth and keep their   promises?


##  notes 5.15.25

* put economics as second part 2 chapter


part 2
1. same as current
2. economy
3. combine heart-opening/closing + racism/hatred
4. combine solidarity / violence-in-service/selfishness

* mention assymetric prison exchanges - early and late in book?


Start all part 2 chapters with healthy cultures?
Endless predation - lightbulb moment leading into part 3
  * our politics aren't working. Right/left, democracy-monarchy, capitalism-communism - these arguments aren't working. 
  * trained to hold back/shut down self - endless predation is what happens, what we can easily predict will happen
