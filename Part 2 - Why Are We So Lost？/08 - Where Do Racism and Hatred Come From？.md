## Chapter 8: Where Do Racism and Hatred Come From?

Many people born and raised in unhealthy cultures seem to think that humans are naturally racist, sexist, and prone to hate. Or at least some are.

This is not true. No one is born racist, sexist, or hateful. Every child, regardless of their culture, is born with an open heart, capable of empathizing with others and full of curiosity.

However, immersed from birth in unhealthy cultures, many babies eventually become confused children who grow up to be racist, sexist, or hateful adults. By then, it all seems quite natural and normal. People are programmed to discriminate against others, but that programming is not inherent in our DNA. It has to be taught.**

How are racism and other kinds of discrimination taught? I believe this relentless training arises from three underlying cultural drivers:

1. _Systemic discrimination_: Rulers and lower authorities artificially impose differences between races by purposely treating different groups of people in different ways in terms of the law, pay, exposure to toxic pollution, how they are commonly represented in news and entertainment, access to food, school funding, and many other conditions. Authorities may also propagate hateful or racist beliefs and then punish anyone who disagrees. 

    For example, in the 1600s, wealthy slaveowners in colonial Virginia decided only black people would be chattel slaves, whereas poor whites could be overseers, shopkeepers, farmers, and soldiers. Poor white people were thus strongly encouraged to support chattel slavery, siding with rich slave owners against the chattel slaves. Anyone who spoke out against this system risked being attacked, imprisoned or killed, including white people, which led to a strong anti-black racism among Virginian white people.**

2. _Adopting an authoritarian attitude_: Many people learn to adopt racist attitudes that are imposed or encouraged by authorities in order to maintain or advance their own privilege, comfort, and safety in their abusive unhealthy culture. Continuing with the example above, white people in colonial Virginia were more likely to support chattel slavery than work together to confront the rich slave owners who kept them all in poverty. We see this in many forms today, as many people adopt attitudes and beliefs that help protect their privilege.**

3. _Child abuse_: Some kinds of child abuse predispose people to embrace authoritarian attitudes. For example, studies show that children who are physically abused are more likely to perpetuate, or at least tolerate, abuse of themselves or others. Since abusive exploitation is common in unhealthy cultures, many abused parents tragically abuse their children or cannot offer loving affection and healthy boundaries, training children to develop hurtful traits.**

How does this work in practice?

A simple children's story illustrates how authorities impose and maintain racism and hatred, similar to major events currently happening in the news.

### Authorities Impose and Maintain Racism and Hatred

Remember that old story "The Emperor's New Clothes"?

A con man tricks an emperor into believing that he is dressed in beautiful, expensive clothing when, in fact, he is wearing nothing at all. Afraid to be called a fool by this very confident man, the emperor pretends that he really is wearing beautiful clothing, and his close officials go along with it. The emperor then goes out among the public stark naked, and the masses of people pretend to admire his fine clothing. Everybody maintains this pretense until a child blurts out that the emperor is nude.

When I first found this story as a child, it seemed silly! Why would all the adults pretend to believe an obvious falsehood? But I have a question for you -- do you think you would point out the king's nakedness? Or would you pretend too?

So what does this old children's story have to teach about ignorance, racism, and hatred happening right now?

In this story, the emperor is the ruler, meaning he decides on the laws and how they're enforced, and he can punish people who express beliefs that he doesn't like. The people in this story know that, and know that it is safer to believe that he is beautifully dressed, or at least pretend. After all, acknowledging the truth could lead to imprisonment or worse.

In unhealthy cultures, it's simply a common pattern for unaccountable authorities to punish people for saying uncomfortable truths. Let's look at some historical examples to see how this works.

In the US pre-Civil War south, chattel slavery was assumed to be good for the slaves by all right-thinking people. Doctors even had a diagnosis called "Draepetomania" where any slave who tried to escape was believed to have a mental illness! Why would they believe such nonsense, even highly trained doctors, instead of simply recognizing the evils of slavery and acknowledging people's healthy desire to escape?

The answer is simple: any white Americans who sympathized with black people and acknowledged the evils of slavery were heavily punished. In the slave states, people could be imprisoned for 10 years for having a copy of _Uncle Tom's Cabin_, a book that showed slavery in a sympathetic light. Draepetomania represents what I call a _blind belief_ where people believe something because authorities make it the safe or convenient thing to believe, not because it's true. In other words, it was safe for doctors to believe the runaway slaves had mental illnesses, and it was unsafe to see runaways as healthy and slavery as evil.

Likewise in the Soviet Union and China in the mid 20th century, the government and society were assumed to be great and getting better, so any activists who fought corruption were assumed to have mental illnesses too. Many activists were arrested and accused of having mental disturbances and sent to prison hospitals where they were treated like the political prisoners they were. These activists were behaving appropriately and trying to serve their people, and authorities made up theories of mental illness as a cover story to justify imprisoning them.

In this social pattern, authorities punish people for speaking the truth, making it safe and socially acceptable to believe falsehoods. Unfortunately, this can also cause huge amounts of racism and hatred in a society, as authorities encourage people to adopt racist or hateful attitudes, and punish those who don't.

The Ku Klux Klan was a campaign of paramilitary violence operated by wealthy ex-slaveowners in the US South after the US Civil War. Most Americans know that this violence was directed at black people to scare them into remaining second class citizens. But few know that this campaign also attacked any white people who sympathized with those black people!

In other words, whites who were racist were left alone or even rewarded. Any anti-racist white people risked rape, murder, having their house burned, or other atrocities. I believe this is has been a major driver of anti-black racism in the US South: authorities wanted that racism to avoid solidarity among poor white and black people, and for centuries they brutally punished any white people who tried to stand for what's right. Many KKK members were sheriffs and politicians, so the law was part of the problem!

Similar stories abound from unhealthy cultures around the world. Nazi Germans and Soviet citizens were each trained by their governments to hate the other side during World War II. Anyone who didn't hate enough risked being called a sympathizer and traitor and going to jail. When these authorities wanted war, they propagated hatred among the populace and punished anyone who spoke the truth and refused to hate.

Why did so many Germans learn to hate Jewish people after World War I? Well, the German monarchy, business leaders, and generals had really screwed up and lost the war. Knowing it was a foregone conclusion, they surrendered before the enemy had crossed into German territory. Unfortunately, they had lied to the German public, and the media contained propaganda which said they were winning the war until the moment they surrendered. Thus many Germans were really confused: why did they surrender if they were winning?

The political, military and business leaders wanted to avoid accountability for losing the war and spreading lies, so they propagated a "stab-in-the-back" narrative, blaming Jews, labor activists, liberals, and others for undermining the country from within.

A tragic number of Germans believed this nonsense, and it wasn't an accident: propagating hate and ignorance towards Jews and activists and blaming them for Germany's WWI defeat was just a way for the ruling class to avoid accountability. Tragically this was one step on the road to the Nazi's holocaust a few years later.

Racism, hatred, and ignorance can thus be widely propagated by authorities to avoid accountability, sabotage solidarity, promote imperial wars, and other reasons. It can be confusing to discuss because authorities will punish someone for one secret reason, but publicly accuse them of something different. For example, present-day Germans who oppose war with Russia have been called "Putin-trolls", a reference to Russian president Putin, essentially calling them traitors instead of brave activists trying to stop an unnecessary war.

I kept finding examples like this, where people are punished for speaking the truth, or punished for not being racist or hateful as authorities expect. And the more I encountered this pattern, the more I saw it play out right in front of me in the news.

For example, as I write in 2025, the United States is supporting Israel in its genocide of the Palestinians. Israel has occupied Palestine for decades, keeping Palestinians under intense surveillance. The control was so tight that even many years ago the Israelis were literally counting the calories of food being allowed in to keep the Palestinians at starvation levels.

The Israelis began the genocide in October 2023, with tremendous US support in the form of weapons, surveillance, fuel, political cover at the United Nations, and more. But just how bad has the violence been? Many news stories say that only 40-50,000 Palestinians have died -- surely a tragedy, but not a genocide.

Before the present conflict started in October 2023, the Palestinian population was estimated at 2.2 million. When US president Trump took office in February 2025, he stated the Palestinian population was around 1.7-1.8 million. Other estimates confirm this, using normal techniques to estimate military and civilian casualties in war. So between October 2023 and February 2025, Israelis had killed ~400,000-500,000 people through military violence, famine, disease, and so on while extremely few Israelis have died in comparison.

How have the Israeli and American governments trained their populations to tolerate and even support this genocide? You guessed it: spreading racist and hateful propaganda towards Palestinians, and punishing anyone who tried to speak the truth and stand up for what's right.

Many government statements have called the Palestinians subhumans who deserve immense cruelty. For example, Israel's defense minister Yoav Gallant said, "We are fighting human animals and we are acting accordingly." Israelis have been trained to see Palestinians as a threat on par with Nazi Germany, rather than victims of a cruel occupation.

In Israel, one school girl expressed sympathy with the Palestinians, saying she hoped they could return to their homes soon. She was suspended from school as other students threatened to burn her house down and the Ministry of Education accused her of "incitement against IDF [Israeli] soldiers."

In America, we see similar disturbances. Anyone who tries to acknowledge the truth about Israeli aggression towards Palestinians is accused of antisemitism. President Trump is deporting many people for attending what he calls "illegal" protests and he accuses universities of tolerating antisemitism for allowing protests against the genocide. This is only an expansion of the policy that his predecessor president Biden started, as the genocide clearly has support from both major political parties. Similar manipulative behavior is happening in many other countries, including Germany, Australia, and the United Kingdom.

And it's not just the government that tries to scare protesters away from acknowledging the truth: many business leaders want to scare people into submission too. One businessman, Kevin O'Leary, went on television and said all activists were being monitored with AI-enabled cameras, and their protesting would be recorded and show up in background checks, and they would never be hired again! In fact, North Carolina outlawed wearing face masks outside just to make this surveillance easier.

Just like American slave owners scared poor and middle class white people into hating black people or remaining silent so they wouldn't oppose slavery, modern day authorities are trying to scare us into submission so we won't oppose their genocide.

Why are so many governments and corporate leaders supporting this genocide? People can only speculate: is it part of a plan for creating a major new west-Asian trade route through Israel? Accessing gas deposits off the Gaza coast? Developing beachfront real estate? All the above, or something else? When leaders are unaccountable, it can be difficult to know why they behave as they do.

So let's take stock: the protests are appropriate, the Israeli genocide against Palestine is real, and it's not antisemitic to point these things out. But a strong coalition of American and Israeli business and political leaders have decided to support this genocide, and they're punishing people for standing for what's right by accusing them of antisemitism and using this as a cover story to justify punishing them.

This shows how ancient patterns of nations with rulers (or ruling classes) are playing out right now. These countries may not have kings, but anytime one person or a group can impose law on the rest, and choose how that law is enforced, you wind up with the same kind of tyranny. This is predictable in any society where people are punished for upholding their own law (because that's supposedly the police's job, but of course they have to follow orders).

Ancient Rome, Germany, the Soviet Union, Israel, Canada, communist China, the capitalist United States -- all of them have shown this pattern where unaccountable leaders punish truth-tellers and propagate racism and hatred when it suits them. All these countries are actually dictatorships: cultures where some people dictate the law, and everyone else is expected to obey it.

This isn't the only dynamic that leads to racism and hate in unhealthy cultures, though it is sadly common. Authorities may encourage divisive racism in countless ways, even when they pretend not to. For example, many governments pretend to administer justice fairly, but actually punish some groups of people with longer prison sentences for the same crime, as seen in academic studies in China, the United States, and the United Kingdom. Then authorities pretend that more-oppressed groups are just more inherently violent or bad. Sadly many people fall for these scams of racism and hatred, believing some groups really are better than others.

When people are trapped with selfish and unaccountable leaders, the results are always tragic. What would it take for a group of people to select the most selfless and honest leaders instead?

### Ending 1: Gracious Receiving: Choose Leaders that Actually Serve the People

Selfish rulers who encourage divisive racism and hate contrast vividly with generous servant-leaders of healthy cultures. What is it about healthy cultures that allows them to have selfless, generous servant-leaders? 

Do they just vote every few years and complain about politicians between elections? Do they believe that "god" chose their leader, and despite the endless corruption, do they have "faith" that "god's will" is being carried out? 

It turns out that it is everyone's responsibility to ensure that only the most selfless people become leaders. Can you imagine having leaders who are so humble that they would never campaign for office? How would they even become leaders then?

Martín Prechtel described how Tzutujil Mayan leaders gave away their wealth each time they reached a new level of leadership, putting them on the same level as everyone else -- and these leaders were expected to _never campaign for office_. Likewise, traditional Cheyenne warriors were trained from childhood never to brag about their moments of bravery, instead trusting that other warriors would tell their stories on their behalf.

It's everyone's responsibility to notice people's good deeds and retell their stories so that people's reputation can grow without any campaigning or bragging.

If you want to be able to live in a healthy culture, with leaders who serve the people instead of selfishly serving themselves, _notice other people's good deeds and tell their stories_. This is based on that first core spiritual practice of practical, aware gratitude for the gifts of others. Each good deed is a gift, and one way to receive that gift graciously is to tell the story so that others know.

When you notice someone who consistently tells the truth even when they could get away with lying, let the person know that you see them, and when appropriate, tell the stories to other people. When someone keeps a promise even when they really don't feel like it, tell the story. When someone consistently shows up to meetings early and well-prepared and helps the group make good decisions, tell those stories. When someone is a source of calm and good humor in difficult moments, or gives generously when they think no one's looking -- _tell those stories_ so that the person's reputation grows.

This is how a group can select the most humble, generous, honest, and capable leaders, including people who would never campaign for a leadership role. When everyone in a culture practices noticing good deeds and retelling the stories, the reputations of the best leaders grow naturally. When it's time to pick a leader, the people will know who it should be.

Given that some healthy cultures have had many tens of thousands of people, and spanned up to 40,000 sq. miles or more, this practice doesn't just work at the village level, but can help nations of any size choose the best people at each level of leadership.

I love telling stories of others' good deeds -- it's fun! Who doesn't like telling and hearing good news? Who doesn't like encouraging and rewarding good behavior? Every retelling is a little celebration.

One Nootka storyteller described the importance of "the mirror in the eyes of the people you love." When someone feels unseen and unappreciated, it can be discouraging. When people know that their neighbors and coworkers see them and feel grateful for their good deeds, they're likely to do more good deeds in the future. It simply feels good to give to grateful people. 

This is the power of that practical, aware gratitude to encourage more good behavior in the world, and every single person has this power. In a healthy culture or healthy subculture, this is how you can help choose leaders who actually serve the people instead of selfishly serving themselves.

What good deeds have you witnessed recently? And to whom could you share these happy stories?

### Ending 2: Cultivate Deep Awareness and Unity Through Nature Connection Practices

How could nature connection practices help people avoid racism and hatred, and cultivate deep awareness and unity instead?

I was pleasantly surprised to discover that that nature connection practices helped me connect with people in a deeper way than I ever had before. After practicing for years, it's clear to me that if a whole group of people embraced these practices, they could be closely connected indeed and there would be no place for racism and hatred.

Every day, I would go to the same spot and pay attention to the nonhumans. I ask what plants grow at what times of the year? What birds live there, and how do they interact with each other and the plants? What animals live there or pass through? I learned to pay attention with all my senses, my eyes, ears, taste, smell, touch, temperature, and more. And I learned to feel curious about the experiences of the beings around me.

I asked myself questions about what I saw. Why would a bird constantly look up as it eats? I learned that they are continuously aware in case predators arrive, so birds constantly eat, look around, eat, and look again. Do some species of tree like growing together and others don't? For example, I learned that black walnuts produce a compound which only some plants find toxic, and thus black walnuts like growing with trees like sugar maple and box elder but avoid trees like white pines.

I continually practiced feeling into the experiences of other beings. For example, I studied hawks and songbirds, and I imagined being a songbird and how terrifying it would be to have a sharp-shinned hawk swoop out of the sky and snatch me in an instant. If I were a songbird, I would probably eat carefully too!

Eventually, I learned that plants and animals could help me notice parts of the landscape I couldn't observe directly. The movement of a bird might indicate a hidden possum moving through low brush. Or, some birds and other animals like deer can see ultraviolet light that is invisible to humans. I might not be able to see rodent poop directly, but birds can see the ultraviolet light reflected off the poop. If I notice birds responding to it, I can learn about the rodents' presence with the birds' help.

The first core spiritual practice -- cultivating a practical, aware gratitude -- is a big part of this daily awareness training. I learned that birds and plants and other beings could teach me about my environment, or they could show me when I'm feeling anxious or stressed. They could help me become more aware about my environment or myself if only I became more aware of them. This awareness is a gift that they give. I learned to feel into the birds and plants and streams around me so that they were extensions of me. Their awareness became an extension of my awareness, and the only limit was how carefully I could pay attention, and how well I could interpret the behaviors I observed.

This is training in deep empathy, and I noticed it also helped me with people. For example, growing up, I learned that women can get extra sensitive during their period. For years I found this annoying and learned to leave women alone during this time. But as with my nature connection practices, I started asking, "how is this a gift?" or "what does this have to teach me?" And I noticed that some women friends would reject food during their period that they normally ate, and when I asked, they said the food was rancid. I would try it and I couldn't taste any rancidity at first. Over time, I learned to taste my food more and more, and I began to notice the occasional rancidity, especially in store-bought food. I realized that the sensitive women had noticed something I couldn't notice. Like the birds, women could show me something about my environment that I couldn't notice directly. When a woman said some food was rancid, even if I couldn't detect it, I began to trust her, and I rejected the food too. Over time this helped me notice rancidity I couldn't notice before.

The more I practiced, the more deeply I could see. For example, when black Americans complain about police brutality, it shows me where my society isn't as healthy or fair as it seems in my experience. When children complain about being forced to sit through boring classes at school, they show me where adults can behave hurtfully without knowing it. I started treating everyone around me like an extension of me, whether men or women or children or nonhumans. I paid attention to what other people observed or how they behaved and let it show me things I couldn't see by myself. I don't blindly trust anyone, but I take care to notice what lessons I can learn from others.

I've had women tell me "you're not a woman, so you can't know what it's like." In a sense, that's true. I'm a man, so I can't know what a woman's experience is like. But by the same logic, I cannot know other men's experiences either. I'm not a black man, so I can't know what a black man's experience is like. I'm neither rich nor impoverished, so I can't know what the rich or poor men's experiences are like. I wasn't born into a healthy culture, so I can't know what that experience is like. And I can't know the experiences of birds or trees.

Ultimately, I can only know my own experience, but this doesn't have to limit me when I practice deep empathy. With enough practice asking questions and paying attention, I can see others' perspectives even if their experiences are really different than mine. I might not always agree with someone else's perspectives, but I can at least understand them and understand their behavior. And when I get it wrong, that just becomes another chance to grow my observation skills and learn.

These nature connection practices are a key part of generating unity in a culture. Once I started really noticing the perspectives of insects and bears and plants, it was easier to understand people's perspectives. When everybody embraces these deep awareness practices, mutual understanding becomes common, and this can help any group find and maintain a deep unity.
