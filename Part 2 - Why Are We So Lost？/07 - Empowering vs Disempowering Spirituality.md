## Chapter 7: Empowering vs Disempowering Spirituality

If you were a king, and you wanted to train your subjects to obey you, how would you do this? Your subjects should learn not to stand up for what's right, and instead passively accept your laws and how you choose to enforce them (or not).

One simple approach would be to impose a religion that trained your subjects to believe that obeying authorities was good and morally right, and disobeying was evil and bad, as seen in Christianity and Islam.

Christianity was first imposed on ancient Rome by Roman emperor Theodosius in 380 CE, and he threatened severe punishment to anyone who didn't convert. And what does the official Christian Bible say? According to 1-Peter 2:13: "Submit yourselves for the Lord's sake to every authority instituted among men: whether to the king, as the supreme authority, or to governors..." Islamic rulers have likewise propagated the same pro-obedience ideology in their religion. The Quran says, "O believers! Obey Allah and obey the Messenger and those in authority among you." Plenty of other authoritarian religions train people to believe that god says to obey their rulers.

It gets worse though. In abusive relationships, the abuser will often try to lower the victim's self-esteem in many ways -- by making them doubt themselves and doubt their own senses, by shaming and belittling them, by training the victim to think they're lucky to live with the abuser and would be worse off on their own. Or abusers may train victims to think abuse is normal in relationships, and victims deserve what they get anyway. Victims who believe these things are more likely to tolerate the abuse and stay in the abusive relationship instead of leaving it.

Unhealthy cultures are massive, multi-generational abusive relationships, and the rulers are the ultimate abusers, with many lower authorities in religion, business, politics, and other areas also abusing or exploiting others. Self-respecting people wouldn't passively submit to abusive authorities, and so, just like in abusive domestic relationships between two people, abusive authorities in every unhealthy culture train their subjects to have low dignity and low self-respect. 

This explains why authoritarian religions and ideologies train people to believe all manner of deeply hurtful things that encourage shame, low self-worth, a sense of disconnection from divinity, fear of one's instincts, rejection of pleasure, a belief that humans are inherently selfish and untrustworthy, beliefs that people deserve to suffer, and more. All these beliefs or attitudes discourage the personal strength and collective solidarity that might allow people to come together, make their own laws to live in a respectful way with each other and the Earth, and uphold those laws together, thereby freeing themselves from their rulers and the deep selfishness in their culture.

As one example, the Catholic Church's official dogma states that humans are "inclined to sin" and have "an inclination to evil." Still one of the most followed religions in the world, Catholicism states that the first human (Adam) "lost the original holiness and justice he had received from God, not only for himself but for all human beings." It's not just humans either that are inherently bad or evil, as Catholic dogma states that human sin "put the world as a whole in the sinful condition." This message that humans are born without holiness, inclined to evil, and disconnected from divinity is deeply shameful and discouraging. And it gets worse -- apparently we were born into a sinful world! What message could possibly encourage more hopelessness?

And Christianity is not the only religion that instills hurtful attitudes. The Islamic Quran likewise causes people to doubt their own sense of right and wrong and trust authorities instead. The Quran repeatedly states Allah's omniscience: "Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful... Surely Allah is Almighty, All-Wise... And Allah is All-Hearing, All-Knowing." The Quran paints the Islamic God Allah as omniscient, and how should a person respond if they have a feeling, urge, or thought that does not align with their authorities' religious text? The Quran is clear: "Perhaps you dislike something which is good for you and like something which is bad for you. Allah knows and you do not know."

Buddhist authorities have pulled the same tricks. Visitors to Tibet prior to the Chinese takeover in the 1950s found Tibetan Buddhists teaching that the world is full of evil. Every bend of the road, stream crossing, or village entrance had to have a row of flags to exorcize evil spirits. Lakes, wells, and streams teamed with demons who brought floods and hail storms upon anyone who violated their religious leaders' rules.

Evil could exist almost anywhere, from doorways to cracks in stones, and -- who would have thought? -- only the priests could protect people from evil, for a fee of course. This ideology scared people from the wilderness, seeing nonhumans as evil spirits rather than teachers and siblings offering gifts. It further trained people to live in fear and kept them in poverty.

Even the Tibetan Buddhist belief in karma has been used to excuse extreme exploitation by rich monks and lamas. The fourteenth Dalai Lama implied that serfs clearly deserve their suffering when he said, "A poor Tibetan was less inclined to envy or resent his Tibetan landlord because he knew that each of them was reaping the seed he had sown in his previous life."

Authoritarian religions also tend to discourage deep sensual pleasure, and buddhism offers a clear example. The Buddha laid out the Four Noble Truths. The second is the Noble Truth of the Cause of Suffering, which is "craving that causes rebirth and is bound up with pleasure and lust and finds delight now here, now there. That is, the craving for sensual pleasures." The third is the "Noble Truth of the Cessation of Suffering" which "is the complete fading away and destruction of this very craving... the liberation from it, leaving no place for it." Thus Buddhism equates desire with suffering, and especially the desire for sensual pleasures. Renouncing this desire for sensual pleasures is supposedly the path to ending suffering.

Authoritarian religions commonly teach divisive sexism, discouraging solidarity by training men to see themselves as somehow superior to women, and training women to accept this. The Islamic Quran notes that "Men are the caretakers of women, as men have been provisioned by Allah over women... And righteous women are devoutly obedient..." The Christian Bible says, "I [God] would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman is the man." Tibetan Buddhist authorities, prior to the 1951 Chinese takeover, stated that working women were bad luck, and "among ten women you'll find nine devils."

If these holy books really are the word of God or Allah, then who could argue with them? But if these religions and "holy" books are simply ideologies imposed on conquered people over many centuries to train them for obedience, then their abusive nature becomes clear.

Tragically, even many non-religious ideologies encourage hurtful attitudes. For example, in my economics classes in college, I was taught that humans are basically selfish, and this is good because the "invisible hand of the market" will organize people and channel their selfishness into productive activities that are good for capitalist society.

Authoritarian ideologies train people to doubt their instincts, or believe they're disconnected from God, evil, shameful, inherently selfish or bad, or only conditionally good (if they obey authority figures). The list of hurtful beliefs is long!

And of course, once people have decided to submit, and forgotten what real freedom is like, rulers historically have tricked them into thinking they're free. That's why the USA calls itself "the land of the free and home of the brave," and the Christian Bible and Islamic Quran urge Christians and Muslims around the world to believe they are free even while obeying their authorities. Focusing on economic "freedom" instead, the Soviet Union's government claimed it was fostering a revolutionary workers' paradise. And yet these are all merely different dictatorships, where a few people dictate the law and everyone else is expected to obey it.

And what are the results of these hurtful religions and ideologies? Unhealthy cultures around the world seem "normal" and "just how life is" to countless inhabitants, including Americans, Chinese, Australians, Koreans, and more! Most citizens may vote, have unproductive political arguments with neighbors, worry about their life after death, pray intensely, wait for a prophet to be reborn and save them, or almost anything except come together in solidarity, create their own laws, and uphold them to create a new healthy culture.

### Authorities Kill or Imprison Our Spiritual Leaders

When authorities outlaw the path to freedom, and people forget what it's like to take deep responsibility for each other and the Earth, they can easily become isolated and spiritually lost, focusing on making money or clinging to whatever comfort and safety they can find.

Spiritual leaders commonly arise in every unhealthy culture to help people walk a good path again. Spiritual leaders like Jesus Christ, Martin Luther King Jr, and countless others have helped people share resources, trust their neighbors, release their shame, increase their self-worth, understand their true history, and more. Jesus Christ was called a "messiah" (which simply means "savior" or "liberator") because the Jews wanted someone to save them from oppressive Roman rule -- they wanted a revolutionary, and Jesus continued doing his work even knowing authorities would kill him for it.

This explains why the Romans killed Jesus Christ, and it explains why the United States government killed Martin Luther King Jr, as demonstrated with copious evidence at a trial in Memphis, Tennessee in 1999. Authorities and their police try to maintain order, and what could be more disruptive of the social order than someone who leads their people to freedom?

In unhealthy cultures, _authorities consistently kill or imprison our greatest spiritual leaders_: the ones who show the most bravery and generosity, and who act in deepest service to end the injustices that always exist when a few people rule over the rest. 

Countless people really believe they need authorities' "leadership" and "strength" to keep them safe, unaware that authorities actually kill or imprison the wisest and bravest among us.

#### How Can Everyone Be Divine If Some People Act with Cruelty and Selfishness?

So are humans inherently selfish or inherently generous? Or does it depend on the person or culture? I believe _divinity speaks through each person's heart_. Each person has a life purpose, or sacred gifts to give, and the divine force in each person's heart will help them find their gifts if they will only listen. 

When people act on that divine voice -- when a person offers their sacred gifts, acting with integrity, generosity, courage, awareness, authenticity, joy, and other beautiful qualities -- then the person is _acting with an open heart_, offering their deepest love. The more a person learns to "hold back" or "shut down" parts of themselves, the more they're _closing their heart to that divine voice_. The ones who hold back the most are often called "cold-hearted" or said to have "hearts of stone." In other words, they don't listen to that divine voice inside them that all people have, and so they act selfishly instead, withholding their gifts.

Don Cox was a black American revolutionary leader in the Black Panthers, and his mother taught him this attitude. Cox said, "Mama was a saint. She taught me that there were no bad people in the world, only those who made mistakes or stumbled along the path of righteousness. That naïve simplicity touched me to the marrow..." 

Martin Luther King Jr was a black American civil rights leader, and in a public speech on the night before he was assassinated, he reflected on the people who wanted to kill him: "What would happen to me from some of our sick white brothers? Well, I don't know what will happen now... I just want to do God's will..." 

These attitudes reflect the same basic truth: no one is inherently bad, but some people have a sickness, or stumble on a good path. And some people get real sick and cause huge amounts of unnecessary suffering. This is what happens when people of unhealthy cultures grow up learning to "hold back" or "shut down" parts of themselves, learning to ignore abuse, ignore uncomfortable feelings or truths, or believe that people are untrustworthy, selfish, or bad.

Many religions and ideologies of unhealthy cultures encourage that sickness, that heart-closure, or that stumbling. They train people to think selfishness is good, or humans are born disconnected from god, or we're inclined to sin and inherently bad, or we can't trust our instincts and feelings and neighbors. When children's love and dignity isn't welcome, many people learn to "hold back" or "shut down" parts of themselves or ignore some parts of reality to get along in their unhealthy culture, which only reinforces these early childhood patterns as people grow into adulthood with deceitful politicians, propaganda-filled media, and authoritarian schools, churches, and jobs. 

No one is inherently bad or selfish. Everyone has love to give. And no matter what's happened in the past, every moment is a fresh chance to show up in the world in a good way.

If everyone truly has deep love to give, how come racism and hatred are so prevalent? Find out in _Chapter 8: The Source of Racism and Hatred, And How to Live Without Them_.
