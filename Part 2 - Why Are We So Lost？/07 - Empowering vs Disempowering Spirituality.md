## Chapter 7: Encouraging vs Discouraging Spirituality**

If you were a king, and you wanted to train your subjects to obey you, what would you do? For starters, you would want to train your subjects to not stand up for what's right, and instead to passively accept your laws and how you choose to enforce them (or not).

And what would be a highly effective way of accomplishing that? How about imposing a religion that trained your subjects to believe that obeying authorities was good and morally right, and disobeying was evil and bad? 

Unfortunately, this is essentially what Christianity, Islam, and many other religions do -- often without people understanding why.

This is sensitive stuff and I want to assure you that I am sticking to the known facts from recorded history. Christianity was first imposed on ancient Rome by Roman emperor Theodosius in 380 CE, and he threatened severe punishment to anyone who didn't convert. And what does the official Christian Bible say? According to 1-Peter 2:13: "Submit yourselves for the Lord's sake to every authority instituted among men: whether to the king, as the supreme authority, or to governors..."

Islamic rulers have also propagated this same pro-obedience ideology in their religion. The Quran says, "O believers! Obey Allah and obey the Messenger and those in authority among you." And of course, plenty of other authoritarian religions train people to believe that god says to obey their rulers.

The trouble runs deeper though. In abusive relationships, the abuser will often try to control the victim by lowering the victim's self-esteem in various ways -- by making them doubt themselves and doubt their own senses, by shaming and belittling them, by training the victim to think they're lucky to live with the abuser and would be worse off on their own. Abusers may train victims to think abuse is normal in relationships, and victims deserve what they get. Not surprisingly, victims who believe these things are more likely to tolerate abuse and stay in abusive relationships instead of leaving them.

Unhealthy cultures all have a ruling class that exploits the rest, so all unhealthy cultures create and maintain massive, multi-generational abusive relationships. The rulers are the ultimate abusers, with many lower authorities in religion, business, politics, and other areas also abusing or exploiting others. 

Self-respecting people generally do not passively submit to abusive authorities. In healthy cultures where people are raised to respect themselves and others, including nonhumans, everyone expects to give and receive mutual kindness. And they typically reject behavior or practices that create or reinforce disrespectful treatment.  

When anyone is disrespected, it's normal for people to respond to protect the victim, just like the Nootka protected the mirror-person discussed in the previous chapter.

Haudenosaunee writers noted how they consistently maintained "the ideology that, if an injustice occurs, it is their moral duty to defend the oppressed against their oppressor" based on the belief that "if absolute justice was established in the world, peace would naturally follow... [and] universal justice is the product of a spiritually strong society." In order to do this, "many of the rules... are designed to create a strong society rather than a strong government."**

However, in unhealthy cultures -- just like in abusive domestic relationships between two people -- abusive authorities consistently treat their subjects poorly, training people to believe all manner of deeply hurtful things that encourage shame, low self-worth, a sense of disconnection from divinity, fear of one's core instincts, rejection of pleasure, a belief that humans are inherently selfish and untrustworthy, beliefs that people deserve to suffer, and more.**

For example, the Catholic Church's official dogma states that humans are "inclined to sin" and have "an inclination to evil." Still one of the most followed religions in the world, Catholicism states that the first human (Adam) "lost the original holiness and justice he had received from God, not only for himself but for all human beings."

And it's not just humans who are inherently bad or evil. Catholic dogma states that human sin "put the world as a whole in the sinful condition." This message that humans are born without holiness, inclined to evil, and disconnected from divinity is deeply shameful and discouraging.

And it gets worse -- apparently we were born into a sinful world that our sinful ways helped create! What message could possibly encourage more hopelessness?

In another example, the Islamic Quran likewise causes people to doubt their own sense of right and wrong, and to trust authorities instead. The Quran repeatedly states Allah's omniscience: "Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful... Surely Allah is Almighty, All-Wise... And Allah is All-Hearing, All-Knowing." The Quran paints the Islamic God Allah as omniscient, and how should a person respond if they have a feeling, urge, or thought that does not align with their authorities' religious text? The Quran is clear: "Perhaps you dislike something which is good for you and like something which is bad for you. Allah knows and you do not know."

Buddhist authorities have pulled the same authority-supporting tricks. Visitors to Tibet prior to the Chinese takeover in the 1950s found Tibetan Buddhists teaching that the world is full of evil. Every bend of the road, stream crossing, or village entrance had to have a row of flags to exorcize evil spirits. Lakes, wells, and streams teamed with demons who brought floods and hail storms upon anyone who violated their religious leaders' rules.

Evil could exist almost anywhere, from doorways to cracks in stones, and -- surprise, surprise -- only the priests could protect people from evil, for a fee of course. This ideology scared people away from the wilderness, seeing nonhumans as evil spirits rather than as their teachers and siblings, offering their gifts. This further trained people to live in fear and kept them in poverty.

Even the Tibetan Buddhist belief in karma has been used to excuse extreme exploitation by rich monks and lamas. The fourteenth Dalai Lama implied that serfs clearly deserve their suffering when he said, "A poor Tibetan was less inclined to envy or resent his Tibetan landlord because he knew that each of them was reaping the seed he had sown in his previous life."

Why would rulers deliberately push these attitudes and beliefs if not to deliberately discourage the personal strength and collective solidarity that might allow people to unite, make their own respectful laws, and uphold those laws together?**

Do you think it's a coincidence that dominant religions discourage the spiritual strength needed for people to free themselves from their rulers and the deep selfishness of their unhealthy culture? This may seem like a stretch for many people to believe, but it sure looks to me like this is no coincidence. Sadly there is even more evidence to back this up.**[xxx-CINDY: moved this and the previous para to slightly later in the section to break up the laundry list of BS.

Have you noticed that authoritarian religions also tend to discourage deep sensual pleasure? Buddhism offers a clear example. The Buddha laid out the Four Noble Truths. Of these, the second is the Noble Truth of the Cause of Suffering, which is "craving that causes rebirth and is bound up with pleasure and lust and finds delight now here, now there. That is, the craving for sensual pleasures." The third is the "Noble Truth of the Cessation of Suffering" which "is the complete fading away and destruction of this very craving... the liberation from it, leaving no place for it." Thus Buddhism equates desire with suffering, and especially the desire for sensual pleasures. Renouncing this desire for sensual pleasures is supposedly the path to ending suffering.

Authoritarian religions commonly teach divisive sexism, discouraging solidarity between men and women by training men to see themselves as superior and training women to submit. The Islamic Quran notes that "Men are the caretakers of women, as men have been provisioned by Allah over women... And righteous women are devoutly obedient..." The Christian Bible says, "I [God] would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman is the man." Tibetan Buddhist authorities, prior to the 1951 Chinese takeover, stated that working women were bad luck, and "among ten women you'll find nine devils."

If these holy books really are the word of God or Allah, then who could argue with them? But what if these religions and "holy" books are simply ideologies imposed on conquered people over many centuries, directly and indirectly training them for obedience?

It doesn't look good, does it?

Tragically, even many non-religious ideologies encourage hurtful attitudes. For example, in my economics classes in college, I was taught that humans are basically selfish, and this is good because the "invisible hand of the market" will organize people and channel their selfishness into productive activities that are good for capitalist society.

Authoritarian ideologies train people to doubt their instincts, or believe they're disconnected from God, evil, shameful, inherently selfish or bad, or only conditionally good (if they obey authority figures). The list of hurtful beliefs is long!

And if people really are so terrible, then of course it's foolish to trust one's neighbors. Thus these beliefs discourage trust too.

Of course, once people have decided to submit, and forgotten what real freedom is like, rulers historically have tricked them into thinking they're free. That's why the USA calls itself "the land of the free and home of the brave," and the Christian Bible and Islamic Quran urge Christians and Muslims around the world to believe they are free even while obeying their authorities. Focusing on economic "freedom" instead, the Soviet Union's government claimed it was fostering a revolutionary workers' paradise. And yet these are all merely different dictatorships, where a few people dictate the law and everyone else is expected to obey it.

And what are the results of these hurtful religions and ideologies? Unhealthy cultures around the world seem "normal" and "just how life is" to countless inhabitants, including Americans, Chinese, Australians, Koreans, and more. Most citizens may vote, have unproductive political arguments with neighbors, worry about their life after death, pray intensely, wait for a prophet to be reborn and save them, or almost anything other than doing the one thing that could actually improve their spiritual, emotional, and physical lives immensely: come together in solidarity, create their own laws, and uphold them to create new healthy cultures.

### Authorities Kill or Imprison Our Spiritual Leaders

When authorities outlaw the path to freedom, and people forget what it's like to take deep responsibility for each other and the Earth, they can easily become isolated and spiritually lost, focusing on making money or clinging to whatever comfort and safety they can find.

Still, that innate human desire to be who we really are runs deep. Spiritual leaders commonly arise in every unhealthy culture to help people walk a good path again. Spiritual leaders like Jesus Christ, Martin Luther King Jr, and countless others have helped people share resources, trust their neighbors, release their shame, increase their self-worth, understand their true history, and more. 

Jesus Christ was called a "messiah" (which simply means "savior" or "liberator") because the Jews wanted someone to save them. But save them from what? They wanted someone to save them from oppressive Roman rule. They wanted a revolutionary, and Jesus stood up and carried on with his revolutionary work even knowing authorities would surely kill him for it. And they did.

Just like the United States government killed Martin Luther King Jr, as documented by copious evidence at a trial in Memphis, Tennessee in 1999. Authorities and their police try to maintain order, and what could be more disruptive of the social order than someone who leads their people to freedom?

In unhealthy cultures, _authorities consistently kill or imprison our greatest spiritual leaders_, the ones who show the most bravery and generosity, who act in deepest service, who work the hardest to end the injustices that always exist when a few people rule over the rest.

Countless people truly believe they need authorities' "leadership" and "strength" to keep them safe, unaware that authorities actually kill or imprison the wisest and bravest leaders among us.

#### How Can Everyone Be Divine If Some People Act with Cruelty and Selfishness?

Are humans inherently selfish or inherently generous? Or does it depend on the person or culture? I believe _divinity speaks through each person's heart_. Each person has a life purpose, or sacred gifts to give, and the divine force in each person's heart will help them find their gifts if they will only listen. 

When people act on that divine voice -- when a person offers their sacred gifts, acting with integrity, generosity, courage, awareness, authenticity, joy, and other beautiful qualities -- then the person is _acting with an open heart_, offering their deepest love. The more a person learns to "hold back" or "shut down" parts of themselves, the more they're _closing their heart to that divine voice_. The ones who hold back the most are often called "cold-hearted" or said to have "hearts of stone." In other words, they don't listen to that divine voice inside them that all people have, and so they act selfishly instead, withholding their gifts.

Don Cox was a black American revolutionary leader in the Black Panthers, and his mother taught him this attitude. Cox said, "Mama was a saint. She taught me that there were no bad people in the world, only those who made mistakes or stumbled along the path of righteousness. That naïve simplicity touched me to the marrow..."

Like Jesus Christ, black American civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr carried on his work knowing he would soon be killed. In a public speech on the night before he was assassinated, he said, "What would happen to me from some of our sick white brothers? Well, I don't know what will happen now... I just want to do God's will..."

I believe that no one is inherently bad, but some people do have a sickness, or stumble on a good path. And some people get really sick and cause huge amounts of unnecessary suffering. This is what happens when people of unhealthy cultures grow up learning to "hold back" or "shut down" sacred parts of themselves, learning to ignore abuse, ignore uncomfortable feelings or truths, or believe that people are untrustworthy, selfish, or bad, each person in their own way.

Many religions and ideologies of unhealthy cultures encourage that sickness, that heart-closure, or that stumbling. They train people to think selfishness is good, or humans are born disconnected from god, or we're inclined to sin and inherently bad, or we can't trust our instincts and feelings and neighbors. When children's love and dignity isn't welcome, many people learn to "hold back" or "shut down" parts of themselves or ignore some parts of reality to get along in their unhealthy culture, which only reinforces these early childhood patterns as people grow into adulthood with deceitful politicians, propaganda-filled media, and authoritarian schools, churches, and jobs. 

No one is inherently bad or selfish. Everyone has love to give. And no matter what's happened in the past, every moment is a fresh new chance to show up in the world in a good way.

If everyone truly has deep love to give, how come racism and hatred are so prevalent? Find out in _Chapter 8: The Source of Racism and Hatred, And How to Live Without Them_.
