# Words of Gratitude

I'm grateful to the people of healthy nations who interviewed with me or wrote about their traditional way of life, both describing key aspects of it and sharing compelling stories. Receiving these perspectives and stories opened my eyes and made this book possible. Special thanks go to Ohiyesa, Mart√≠n Prechtel, Nancy Basket, Robin Kimmerer, the unnamed collective authors of _A Basic Call to Consciousness_, Anne Cameron, and the Zapatistas who published many articles online.

And thanks to the people who lived with or interviewed people of healthy nations and wrote about them respectfully, including Jean Liedloff and Frank Linderman.

I specially thank my editor Cindy Spitzer. I appreciated your patience as we worked and reworked the material. You supported my ambitious timelines and helped me change my writing style to make this book as engaging as possible. I couldn't ask for a better editor. It has been a pleasure working with you.

Thank you to the early readers. Your feedback made a big difference.
