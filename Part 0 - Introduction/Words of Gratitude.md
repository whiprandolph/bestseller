## Words of Gratitude

...

This book is based off the research I did for my first book, _One Disease One Cure_, and so I feel even more grateful to all the same people and nonhumans who helped me write that one. A few extra words of gratitude are in order though.

I specially thank my editor Cindy Spitzer. I appreciated your patience and grace as we worked and reworked the same material. You supported my ambitious timelines and helped change my writing style to make this book as engaging as possible. I couldn't ask for a better editor. It has been a pleasure working with you.

While writing this book, I repeatedly felt grateful to everyone of healthy cultures who interviewed or wrote down valuable perspectives. Books like Ohiyesa's _The Soul of the Indian_, Black Elk's interviews with John Neihardt (_Black Elk Speaks_), Mart√≠n Prechtel's _Secrets of the Talking Jaguar_, the Nootkas' interviews in Anne Cameron's _Daughters of Copper Woman_, the presentations contained in _Original Instructions_, Wikis' interviews with George Grinnell in _When Buffalo Ran_, Robin Kimmerer's _Braiding Sweetgrass_, Geronimo's interviews with SM Barrett (_Geronimo's Story of His Life_), Pretty Shield's interviews in Frank Linderman's _Pretty Shield_, _A Basic Call to Consciousness_ written by a collection of Mohawk writers within the Haudenosaunee Confederacy, and many other books contain so many profound insights and stories.

I consider all of you my mentors, and I feel extremely grateful for these writings which have opened my eyes and softened my heart. I could not have written _One Disease One Cure_ or _The Deepest Revolution_ without encountering similar deep wisdom in book after book, interview after interview.

May the wisdom of healthy cultures keep spreading and lead to many Deep Revolutions.
