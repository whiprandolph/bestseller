# Words of Gratitude

Thanks to the nonhumans who helped me write this book. Thanks to the Carolina wrens who lifted my spirits in the morning, the wild dandelions and chickweed that nourished me, and the trees on the edge of a local clearcut logging operation who reminded me to stand strong in the face of terrible things.

I would not have known how to feel grateful for the nonhumans' gifts if it weren't for the Kamana program. Thanks to Jon Young and all the contributors who produced it.

Thank you to Mike Paul for your quick friendship and trust and inviting me to meet the Ashaninka. Thanks to the Ashaninka for showing me what a healthy nation is like.

I'm grateful to the people of healthy nations who interviewed with me or wrote about their traditional way of life in beautiful detail, including Black Elk, Pretty Shield, Ohiyesa, Mart√≠n Prechtel, Nancy Basket, Robin Kimmerer, the unnamed authors of _A Basic Call to Consciousness_, and the Zapatista writers.

And thanks to those who studied people of healthy nations and wrote about them respectfully, including Jean Liedloff, George Grinnell, Anne Cameron, and Frank Linderman.

Special thanks go to my editor Cindy Spitzer. I appreciated your patience as we worked and reworked the material. You supported my ambitious timelines and helped me change my writing style to make this as engaging as possible. I couldn't ask for a better editor. It has been a pleasure working with you.

Thank you to the early readers for holding this book to a high standard. Your feedback made a big difference.

Thanks to Bob, Seraina, Nina, Owen, Tod and Lindsey for your support.

Lastly, thanks to everyone who makes important information freely available online, including Internet Archive, Anna's Archive, Sci-Hub, ratical.org, and Wikileaks.
