## Words of Gratitude

This book is based off the research I did for my first book, _One Disease One Cure_, and so I feel even more grateful to all the same people and nonhumans who helped me write that one. A few extra words of gratitude are in order though.

I specially thank my editor Cindy Spitzer. I appreciated your patience as we worked and reworked the material. You supported my ambitious timelines and helped me change my writing style to make this book as engaging as possible. I couldn't ask for a better editor. It has been a pleasure working with you.

Huge thanks to the early readers. Your feedback helped make this book what it is.
