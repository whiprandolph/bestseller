## Important Notes on Sensitive Topics

### Capitalization of People's Titles

I chose not to capitalize anybody's title in this book, including president, chief, king, doctor, or anything else. Healthy cultures maintain a baseline of mutual respect for everyone, and they consistently describe the importance of keeping everyone on the same level. For example, the San remind their hunters of how much they depend on their neighbors, and not to feel superior in any way. Tzutujil Mayans expected new chiefs to ritually give away all their things so they were on the same economic level as everyone else.

Every human is divine, and no one is inherently more worthy of respect than anyone else. Making people's titles lowercase helped remind me that no one's title makes them special. And people without titles are not less worthy of respect.
