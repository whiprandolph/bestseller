# Revolutionary Activities -- Because This is Not a Theoretical Book

Dear Reader,

This is a practical book about the Deepest Revolution. It is not theoretical. The Deepest Revolution is too important to just think about it.

If you want to join the party, you need to cultivate yourself.

I have included Revolutionary Activities which I believe will help you embrace attitudes and skills that I believe are essential to living in solidarity with other people and the Earth, based on the clear stories and perspectives from dozens of healthy cultures I have studied.

These are not like many school homework assignments where you complete them once and move on. Many of these could be life-long practices, even daily, and the more you work them, the deeper they will take you on a beautiful path of deep meaning and connection.

I have personally embraced all the activities in Part 1, Part 2, and most in Part 3, and they have made a huge difference in my life and I believe they can do the same for others. I believe these practices can lay the groundwork to help people come together and form healthy cultures.

However, I have not successfully worked with others to realize the Deepest Revolution, and so I have not been able to complete all the activities in Part 3. Even though I haven't been able to complete all the activities, I know the work needs to be done.
