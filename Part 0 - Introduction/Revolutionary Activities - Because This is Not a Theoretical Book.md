## Revolutionary Activities -- Because This is Not a Theoretical Book

This is a book about The Deepest Revolution -- proof that it's possible to live in a nation without injustice and corruption, why our current way of life isn't working, and inspirational stories from healthy cultures to help guide the way.

But no one will give you a beautiful healthy culture to be part of. No one will hand you a beautiful way of life on a silver platter.

This book isn't about a "solution" -- it's about a journey. I can't tell you every step needed to have a successful Deep Revolution, but I can tell you the kind of person you'd need to be to take part in it.

After studying many healthy cultures and multiple Deep Revolutions, I noticed the people in these societies all have certain things in common -- things like deep connection with the Earth, integrity, bravery, joy, respect for children, mutual understanding, gratitude, and more. They have the spiritual strength to confront injustice, hold on to deep truths even while the media spreads lies and distractions, and release all shame. Each person gives their deepest love each moment as a normal way of life.

Sounds like a cool group of people to be around, right? 

That's why this book includes dozens of Revolutionary Activities. I urge you to complete the activities. Let them challenge you. And don't just do each activity once, but do them repeatedly, so they become a way of life. I know from experience that the more you work these activities, the deeper they will take you on a beautiful path of deep meaning and connection.

I believe that if you grew up in a healthy culture, many of these activities would be normal parts of your childhood training. But for people that didn't grow up in healthy cultures, they'll train us to play a good part in the Deepest Revolution.
