# Revolutionary Activities -- This is Not a Theoretical Book

This is a book about The Deepest Revolution -- proof that it's possible to live in a nation without injustice and corruption, why our current way of life isn't working, and inspirational stories from healthy nations to help guide the way to creating new ones.

But no one will give you a beautiful healthy nation to be part of. No one will hand you a beautiful way of life on a silver platter.

This book isn't about a "solution" -- it's about a journey. I can't tell you every step needed to have a successful Deep Revolution, but I can tell you the kind of person you'd need to be to take part in it.

After studying many healthy nations and multiple Deep Revolutions, I noticed the people in these societies all have certain things in common -- things like deep connection with the Earth, integrity, bravery, joy, respect for children, mutual understanding, generosity, gratitude, and more. They have the spiritual strength to confront injustice, align their lives with the deepest truth, and live without shame. Each person gives their deepest love each moment as a normal way of life.

Sounds like a cool group of people to be around, right? 

This book includes dozens of Revolutionary Activities meant to help you cultivate these qualities. I urge you to complete the activities. Let them challenge you. And don't just do each activity once, but do them repeatedly, so they become a way of life. I know from experience that the more you work these activities, the deeper they will take you on a beautiful path of deep meaning and connection.

I believe that if you grew up in a healthy nation, many of these activities would be normal parts of your childhood training. But for people that didn't grow up this way, they'll train us to play a good part in the Deepest Revolution.
