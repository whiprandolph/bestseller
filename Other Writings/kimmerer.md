## Letter to Robin Kimmerer

Dear Professor Kimmerer,

I'm writing to you because I want to say thanks for some big lessons I've learned from Braiding Sweetgrass, and I have a request.

I'm really grateful for your clear writing about gift economy attitudes, especially in your chapter "The Gift of Strawberries." I had read Lakota writings and heard Cherokee stories that referenced similar gift economy attitudes, but your clear description really helped me understand how beautiful a gift economy could be, and how people really could maintain a way of life based on sharing.

For years, I'd studied endless corruption in the United States and other unhealthy nations, and people commonly debate whether capitalism, communism, or socialism is better. But your explanation and stories about a gift economy show the kind of economy that would let people live in a respectful way. And your description of indian giving makes perfect sense!

The piece about the Windigo really touched me too, discussing how terrible selfishness could be if it were ever allowed to take hold. When you wrote that people acting selfishly are "first counseled, then ostracized, and if the greed continued, they were eventually banished..." that showed me how important it is for a community to respond to selfishness and insecurity so that people can maintain trust and generosity between each other.

I'm thankful for many other lessons, but I will save those for later.

I have a request. I wrote a book called The Deepest Revolution. Would you be willing to read it and offer a testimonial? If you do not wish to offer a testimonial after reading, I would welcome any feedback as well.

The Deepest Revolution stems from a realization I had a few years ago: unhealthy nations like the USA, France, and Japan all have similar problems like corruption, greed, discrimination, and widespread child abuse or deprivation. And yet these problems don't seem to exist in native nations living in traditional times.

Furthermore, no feminist movement has ever ended sexism in their unhealthy nation, and no civil rights movement has ended racism. No political movement has ended corruption. No environemntal movement has ended exploitation of the Earth. And yet healthy nations in traditional times seem to live without these problems. I am passionate about confronting all these injustices, and I want to find an effective way to do that.

The Deepest Revolution is my attempt to explain why these terrible problems never go away in unhealthy nations, and also to learn the deepest lessons I can from healthy nations, including the Potawatomi, Nootka, San, Apache, and many others. My book cites Braiding Sweetgrass several times.

If people wanted to create a way of life without corruption and greed, where the whole nation takes people's and the Earth's needs into account as a normal way of life, how could they do this, based on the words and stories of people of healthy nations? That's what the Deepest Revolution is about.

And I would love to hear your thoughts, and ideally a testimonial if you are willing to offer one.

Thank you for the wisdom you've shared in your books, and thank you for reading this letter. I look forward to hearing from you.
