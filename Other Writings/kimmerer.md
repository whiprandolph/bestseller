## Letter to Robin Kimmerer

Dear Professor Kimmerer,

I want to thank you for some life lessons I learned from Braiding Sweetgrass. I’ve lived in intentional communuties and often struggled to have the depth of trusting relationships I wanted. Learning about gift economies showed me how people really could maintain a way of life based on sharing, and your writings about the Windigo showed how selfishness and insecurity are key troubles to address in order to have trusting relationships. I’ve been able to have stronger relationships after reading your book, so thank you for writing it.

I wrote a book called The Deepest Revolution which contains the biggest lessons I've learned from you and many other indigenous writers. Why do civilized nations all have similar problems, like corruption, greed, and discrimination, and how are indigenous nations living in traditional times able to avoid these problems? If people who've forgotten their indigenous ancestry wanted to create a society where people live respectfully with each other and the Earth, what lessons would we need to learn from traditional societies? My book cites Braiding Sweetgrass many times.

If you are interested in reading the book, I would love to hear your thoughts. Thank you for the wisdom you've shared in your books, and thank you for reading this letter. I look forward to hearing from you.
