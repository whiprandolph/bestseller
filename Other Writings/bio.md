## Bio

I'm Will Randolph, and I grew up in a white, middle class, Christian family outside Washington DC in northern Virginia. My father was an officer in the US Air Force and my mother was a doctor.

I grew up believing strongly in democracy and capitalism. It seemed like America was good overall and just had some problems here and there that people could fix. I actually studied investing in high school, and I looked forward to investing in companies that made America what it is, getting rich while supporting my country. This made sense to me, getting rich and doing good could be the same path.

I graduated college and started working in the so-called "defense" industry making cyber weapons for corporate and government clients.

Over time, I kept studying different kinds of corruption -- imperialism, dishonest politicians who push wars based on lies, poisons in food, environmental pollution and climate change, deforestation, and more, and I realized I was part of the problem. I supported imperialism with my work, and me and all my coworkers pretended to believe the lies the politicians told about what they were doing with the weapons we made. My consumption and way of life led to pollution and environmental destruction.

Unintentionally, I was contributing to so many problems I saw in the world, instead of helping end them.

By 2013 I knew I wanted to leave that way of life behind and find a better way to live. I started visiting different intentional communities, and went to live in one on western North Carolina in 2014. But in all these intentional communities, I saw that they had unintentionally reproduced many core aspects of the unhealthy culture they were trying to get away from.

There were haves and have-nots, and the have-nots often felt unable to speak clearly to the haves. People fought over jobs to do, not because the work needed doing or was satisfying, but because they needed work to pay the community taxes. People would lie, and others would pretend not to be upset and trust them the same as before, so that a low level of trust was common.

There was lots of beauty, and I'm very grateful for the time at these places - I made friends, learned about organic gardening and natural building construction, and much more. But at a really deep level, the communities reproduced deep troubles in the unhealthy nation they were trying to get away from.

I had one chat with an elder who acknowledged that she'd been at her community for decades and didn't feel satisfied. This hit me hard. I admired that "go for it" energy, build the path as you walk it, and I could imagine myself co-founding a community some day. But if these people walked that path and recreated so many aspects of the broader unhealthy culture, why would I think I could do any different?

In 2014, I first read about healthy nations, or what most people call native or indigenous people. I find those words confusing, so I use "healthy nation" instead, and I can explain that later. But I started reading about how people in healthy nations live or lived in traditional times, and it seemed really different. So I set out to go find people living in a way I admired.

If you only ever study sick people, you don't learn what healthy is like. So I wanted to study a village or nation living in a healthy way so I could learn from them.

It took a long time, but eventually I succeeded, and it was so beautiful. Changed my life forever. One day I made quick friends with an Englishman who'd been visiting this nation, called the Ashaninka, for over 30 years. He told me "you'll spend the rest of your life figuring out lessons to learn from these people."

I share lots of stories from them in my 2 books. But they taught me that it's possible to live without corruption and greed, where integrity and generosity are normal. And they taught me how good that feels.

In the following couple years, I kept studying healthy and unhealthy nations, and I noticed a few more big things that really hit me.

For one, I kept reading similarly beautiful stories from healthy nations living in traditional times -- they didn't have corruption, greed, discrimination, or child abuse. Sharing was normal, and leaders were trusted. They might have wars or famines, but they didn't have abuse or exploitation within the culture.

The other big thing was this: unhealthy nations all have the same problems, and they never go away. Every unhealthy nation has sexism, and no feminist movement has ever ended sexism in their unhealthy nation. Every unhealthy nation has racism and privilege, and no civil rights movement has ended this. No labor movment has ever ended the exploitation of workers, and no peace movement has ever gotten politicians to stop telling lies in support of wars that serve the rich.

Like, these social movements have a 0% success rate across every unhealthy nation all around the world going back thousands of years! WTF! France, Russia, Ecuador, South Africa, Vietnam, you name it. 0% success rate.

Would you invest in a business venture with a 0% success rate? I wouldn't! It's ridiculous! But literally no feminist movement, peace movement, civil rights movement or whatever has ever fully addressed their problems in their unhealthy nation.

I was passionate about confronting injustice and pollution, but I saw activists had been confronting these things for centuries around the world, and yet the problems continued. Whatever trap we're stuck in, I don't want to be stuck too. It's like an endless cycle, and whatever people are doing, even brave activists, isn't addressing the root of the problem. So what could I do differently? What do the Ashaninka have to teach?

I visited Occupy Wall St camps a few times and I watched many videos from Occupy Wall St, with the bravest activists being beat up and arrested by the police. And I read the same stories from the Soviet Union, Germany, Mexico, many countries -- the bravest, most generous servant-leaders kept getting attacked or even killed, and the deep corruption continued. What could I do differently? And why bother doing anything if these amazing activists who confront injustice just get imprisoned or killed and the problems continue?

I kept finding stories of nations like the Ashaninka, without corruption, crime, and greed. The Haudenosaunee, Lakota, Cherokee, Apache, and many more around the world, now or in recent times. And they helped me see how people can maintain a respectful way of life among each other, so that respect is normal in a nation. They may or may not be respectful to outsiders. But within the nation, respect and generosity and trust are normal.

But how? Why is my country stuck with huge problems that never end? I felt strongly drawn to stories from healthy nations for personal growth reasons too - there are stories of men of deep integrity and bravery, not just one or two but all the men of a nation. There are stories of deep trust and generosity, stories of strong children, stories of love, adventure and passion. The stories are beautiful and inspiring and helped me grow as a man. I didn't know what to do with them or really understand what I was reading, but I kept studying.

A few years ago, I gathered all the stories I'd found from healthy nations and all the ones I'd found from unhealthy nations, even before I'd come up with those names, and I made big lists. Then I broke the lists down into groups by themes. In initially it was a few pages of bullet notes, and my ideas were very superficial compared to now. But I knew I'd found something real. Perspectives that could help me address the deepest corruption in my society.

Eventually I learned - healthy nations living in traditional times live or lived in freedom. And we don't. 






Three big things
* grew up white, middle class Christian, believing in democracy and capitalism and wanting to contribute, proud of country
    * but learned about corruption, imperialism, systemic racism, sexism, selfishness, and privilege, and realized the corruption was deep, and it always had been this way in this country

* visited intentional communities to learn to live in a different way
    * but learned that they reproduced social problems people were trying to get away from

* Realized every unhealthy nation had sexism, greed, corruption, racism, child abuse, pollution
    * no movement had ever succeeded in actually eradicating any of these problems
    * but healthy nations don't have these problems

So that's my background. I am passionate about ending corruption, greed, discrimination, and pollution, after studying healthy nations that don't have these problems, I've learned some things I'm really excited to share about how we could live without these problems too.
