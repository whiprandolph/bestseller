## Letter to Robin Kimmerer

Dear Mr. Prechtel,

I want to thank you for some life lessons I learned from Secrets of the Talking Jaguar. I've lived in intentional communities and often struggled to have the depth of trusting relationships I wanted. You described leaders who who give away all their things and gained their roles without campaigning. This really opened my eyes to the level of generosity and humility people could have with each other and challenged me to grow in these ways. Thanks for these and many other lessons.

I wrote a book called The Deepest Revolution which contains the biggest lessons I've learned from you and many other indigenous writers. Why do civilized nations all have similar problems, like corruption, greed, and discrimination, and how are indigenous nations living in traditional times able to avoid these problems? If people who've forgotten their indigenous ancestry wanted to create a society where people live respectfully with each other and the Earth, what lessons would we need to learn? It cites Secrets of the Talking Jaguar many times.

If you are interested in reading the book, I would love to hear your thoughts. Thank you for the wisdom you've shared in your books, and thank you for reading this letter. I look forward to hearing from you.
