## Letter to Oren Lyons

Dear Chief Lyons,

I want to thank you for some life lessons I learned from your presentation at a Bioneers conference, as written in the book Original Instructions. Your clear description of the role of clan mothers in choosing leaders showed a beautiful way for women and men to collaborate. When you said it's normal in many nations for people to remove leaders who disappoint them, you showed me that people don't have to live with unaccountable leaders. You showed me that another way of life is possible.

I wrote a book called The Deepest Revolution which contains the biggest lessons I've learned from you and many other indigenous writers and speakers. Why do civilized nations all have similar problems, like corruption, greed, and discrimination, and how are indigenous nations living in traditional times able to avoid these problems? If people who've forgotten their indigenous ancestry wanted to create a society where people live respectfully with each other and the Earth, what lessons would we need to learn from traditional societies? My book cites your presentation several times.

If you are interested in reading the book, I would love to hear your thoughts. Thank you for the wisdom you've shared, and thank you for reading this letter. I look forward to hearing from you.
