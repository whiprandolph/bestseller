## Letter to Jeannette Armstrong

Dear Professor Armstrong,

I want to thank you for some life lessons I learned from your presentation at a Bioneers conference, as written in the book Indigenous Instructions. Your description of en'owkinwiwx offered a beautiful model for how people could take people's and nonhumans' needs into account. And your description of "the most secure feeling in the world" knowing that people in the community will take care of each other was beautiful and inspiring. It showed me how good people can be with each other and challenged me to build this depth of trusting relationships in my life.

I wrote a book called The Deepest Revolution which contains the biggest lessons I've learned from you and many other indigenous writers. Why do civilized nations all have similar problems, like corruption, greed, and discrimination, and how are indigenous nations living in traditional times able to avoid these problems? If people who've forgotten their indigenous ancestry wanted to create a society where people live respectfully with each other and the Earth, what lessons would we need to learn? It cites your presentation several times.

If you are interested in reading the book, I would love to hear your thoughts. Thank you for the wisdom you've shared, and thank you for reading this letter. I look forward to hearing from you.
