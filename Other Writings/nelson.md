## Letter to Oren Lyons

Dear Professor Nelson,

I want to thank you for some life lessons I learned from your edited book Original Instructions. I learned so much from the different Bioneers presentations in it. Jeannette Armstrong's description of en'owkinwiwx offered a beautiful model for how people could take people's and nonhumans' needs into account, and the deep sense of security that results. Oren Lyons clearly described how the Haudenosaunee choose leaders who serve the people, showing it really is possible to live without unaccountable leaders. 

I wrote a book called The Deepest Revolution which contains the biggest lessons I've learned from you and many other indigenous writers and speakers. Why do civilized nations all have similar problems, like corruption, greed, and discrimination, and how are indigenous nations living in traditional times able to avoid these problems? If people who've forgotten their indigenous ancestry wanted to create a society where people live respectfully with each other and the Earth, what lessons would we need to learn from traditional societies? My book cites presentations in your book several times.

If you are interested in reading the book, I would love to hear your thoughts. Thank you for the wisdom you've shared, and thank you for reading this letter. I look forward to hearing from you.
