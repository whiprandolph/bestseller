## Chapter 6: Empowering Vs Disempowering Spirituality

If you were a king, and you wanted to train your subjects to obey you, how would you do this? Your subjects should learn not to stand up for what's right, and instead passively accept your laws and how you choose to enforce them (or not).

One simple approach would be to impose a religion that trained your subjects to believe that obeying authorities was good and morally right, and disobeying was evil and bad, as seen in Christianity and Islam.

Christianity was first imposed on ancient Rome by Roman emperor Theodosius in 380 CE, and he threatened severe punishment to anyone who didn't convert. And what does the official Christian Bible say? According to 1-Peter 2:13: "Submit yourselves for the Lord's sake to every authority instituted among men: whether to the king, as the supreme authority, or to governors..." Islamic rulers have likewise propagated the same pro-obedience ideology in their religion. The Quran says, "O believers! Obey Allah and obey the Messenger and those in authority among you." Plenty of other authoritarian religions train people to believe that god says to obey their rulers.

It gets worse though. In abusive relationships, the abuser will often try to lower the victim's self-esteem in many ways -- by making them doubt themselves and doubt their own senses, by shaming and belittling them, by training the victim to think they're lucky to live with the abuser and would be worse off on their own. Or abusers may train victims to think abuse is normal in relationships, and victims deserve what they get anyway. Victims who believe these things are more likely to tolerate the abuse and stay in the abusive relationship instead of leaving it.

Unhealthy cultures are massive, multi-generational abusive relationships, and the rulers are the ultimate abusers, with many lower authorities in religion, business, politics, and other areas also abusing or exploiting others. Self-respecting people couldn't be expected to passively submit to abusive authorities, and so, just like in abusive domestic relationships between two people, abusive authorities in every unhealthy culture train their subjects to have low dignity and low self-respect. 

This explains why many authoritarian religions and ideologies train people to believe all manner of deeply hurtful things that encourage shame, low self-worth, a sense of disconnection from divinity, fear of one's instincts, rejection of pleasure, a belief that humans are inherently selfish and untrustworthy, beliefs that people deserve to suffer, and more. All these beliefs or attitudes discourage the personal strength and collective solidarity that might allow people to come together, make their own laws to live in a respectful way with each other and the Earth, and uphold those laws together, thereby freeing themselves from their rulers and the deep selfishness in their culture.

As one example, the Catholic Church's official dogma states that humans are "inclined to sin" and have "an inclination to evil." Still one of the most-followed religions in the world, Catholicism states that the first human (Adam) "lost the original holiness and justice he had received from God, not only for himself but for all human beings." It's not just humans either that are inherently bad or evil, as Catholic dogma states that human sin "put the world as a whole in the sinful condition." This message that humans are born without holiness, inclined to evil, and disconnected from divinity is deeply shameful and discouraging. And it gets worse -- apparently we were born into a sinful world! What message could possibly encourage more hopelessness?

And Christianity is not the only religion that instills hurtful attitudes. The Islamic Quran likewise causes people to doubt their own sense of right and wrong and trust authorities instead. The Quran repeatedly states Allah's omniscience: "Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful... Surely Allah is Almighty, All-Wise... And Allah is All-Hearing, All-Knowing." The Quran paints the Islamic God Allah as omniscient, and how should a person respond if they have a feeling, urge, or thought that does not align with their authorities' religious text? The Quran is clear: "Perhaps you dislike something which is good for you and like something which is bad for you. Allah knows and you do not know."

Buddhist authorities have pulled the same tricks. Visitors to Tibet prior to the Chinese takeover in the 1950s found Tibetan Buddhists teaching that the world is full of evil. Every bend of the road, stream crossing, or village entrance had to have a row of flags to exorcize evil spirits. Lakes, wells, and streams teamed with demons who brought floods and hail storms upon anyone who violated their religious leaders' rules.

Evil could exist almost anywhere, from doorways to cracks in stones, and -- who would have thought? -- only the priests could protect people from evil, for a fee of course. This ideology scared people from the wilderness, seeing nonhumans as full of evil spirits rather than teachers and siblings offering gifts. It further trained people to live in fear and kept them in poverty.

Even the Tibetan Buddhist belief in karma has been used to excuse extreme exploitation by rich monks and lamas. The fourteenth Dalai Lama implied that serfs clearly deserve their suffering when he said, "A poor Tibetan was less inclined to envy or resent his Tibetan landlord because he knew that each of them was reaping the seed he had sown in his previous life."

Authoritarian religions also tend to discourage deep sensual pleasure, and buddhism offers a clear example. The Buddha laid out the Four Noble Truths. The second is the Noble Truth of the Cause of Suffering, which is "craving that causes rebirth and is bound up with pleasure and lust and finds delight now here, now there. That is, the craving for sensual pleasures." The third is the "Noble Truth of the Cessation of Suffering" which "is the complete fading away and destruction of this very craving... the liberation from it, leaving no place for it." Thus Buddhism equates desire with suffering, and especially the desire for sensual pleasures. Renouncing this desire for sensual pleasures is supposedly the path to ending suffering.

Authoritarian religions commonly encourage divisive sexism, discouraging solidarity by training men to see themselves as somehow superior to women, and training women to accept this. The Islamic Quran notes that "Men are the caretakers of women, as men have been provisioned by Allah over women... And righteous women are devoutly obedient..." The Christian Bible says, "I [God] would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman is the man." Tibetan Buddhist authorities, prior to the 1951 Chinese takeover, stated that working women were bad luck, and "among ten women you'll find nine devils."

Tragically, even many non-religious ideologies train these sorts of hurtful attitudes. In my economics classes in college, I was taught that humans are basically selfish, and this is good because the "invisible hand of the market" will organize people and channel their selfishness into productive activities that are good for capitalist society.

Authoritarian ideologies train people to doubt their instincts, or believe they're disconnected from God, evil, shameful, inherently selfish or bad, or only conditionally good (if they obey authority figures). The list of hurtful beliefs is long!

And of course, once people have decided to submit, and forgotten what real freedom is like, rulers historically have tricked them into thinking they're free. That's why the USA calls itself "the land of the free and home of the brave," and the Christian Bible urges Christians around the world to believe they are free even while obeying their authorities. Focusing on economic "freedom" instead, the Soviet Union's government claimed it was fostering a revolutionary workers' paradise. And yet these are all merely different dictatorships, where a few people dictate the law and everyone else is expected to obey it.

And what are the results of these hurtful religions and ideologies? Unhealthy cultures around the world seem "normal" and "just how life is" to countless inhabitants, including Americans, Chinese, Australians, Koreans, and more! Most citizens may vote, get angry at their neighbors, worry about their life after death, pray intensely, wait for a prophet to be reborn and save them, or almost anything except come together in solidarity, create their own laws, and uphold them in the face of authoritarian violence. When auhorities outlaw the path to freedom, and people forget what it's like to take deep responsibility for each other and the Earth, all manner of 

Countless people really believe they need authorities' "leadership" and "wisdom" to keep them safe, not trusting that there could ever be a way of life where people live respectfully together without any authorities at all.

Societies that forbid people from taking deep responsibility to uphold their own laws, with a few rich and a lot of poor, that pollute the Earth instead of enriching it, with racism and sexism and greed -- these societies all seem normal and acceptable to countless people who have been trained not to stand for what's right, and embrace obedience, selfishness, depression, distrust, shame, ignorance, superficiality, resignation, distraction, or other hurtful qualities instead. 

Indeed, if humans are inherently selfish or inclined to evil, how could there possibly be whole nations without these troubles?

### Three Core Spiritual Practices of Healthy Cultures

What kind of belief systems would societies propagate where everyone is raised to have the personal strength to stand for what's right, and stand in solidarity with their neighbors and the Earth?

What sorts of spiritual practices would help a person feel most fully alive, be their best selves, and develop the deepest, most meaningful connections possible with the humans and nonhumans around them?

In some ways, every healthy culture is unique. But I notice the same three core spiritual practices in every healthy culture I've ever studied.

#### The First Core Spiritual Practice: A Practical, Aware Gratitude

The first practice is cultivating a practical, aware gratitude for the gifts of life. When I started doing nature connection practices, the first step was going to a place every day where I could observe the nonhumans there. I learned to notice which plants are edible, and which trees offer good wood for burning.

The more I learned about how every creature contributes to the web of life, the more I learned to feel grateful for. Some trees are especially good at holding the soil in place on the edge of a stream -- holding the soil down is a gift they give. Birds' songs can alert me to nearby animals that I cannot see myself. Animals give the gifts of meat and hides for food and clothing. Streams give water for drinking. The sun gives us all warmth and light.

All these things are gifts. No one makes the trees offer their gifts of firewood. I can plant an apple tree and tend it, but I cannot make it bear fruit -- that's its gift. The first core practice I found is to notice all the gifts I receive, and feel grateful for them.

Every healthy culture has its own ways of expressing gratitude, but they all have _some_ way. The Haudenosaunee have their beautiful Thanksgiving Address, where they methodically name many kinds of life and give thanks for the gifts of each one. Okanaga woman Jeannette Armstrong described how they love other species as brothers and sisters. Potawatomi woman Robin Kimmerer described how humans are the "younger brothers of Creation" and our older nonhuman siblings can teach many gifts of wisdom.

I'll never forget my first clear lesson from a nonhuman, a hunting lesson from red-shouldered hawks. I was walking through a forest and observed a single hawk flying and screeching overhead. Red-shouldered hawks like to hunt small animals like mice and shrews, so I knew they all would be acutely aware of the predator flying above. I assumed the hawk wasn't interested in hunting, since otherwise, why make so much noise?

I looked up through the forest canopy just in time to notice a second, silent hawk fly to the first one. Once they were together, the loud hawk flew in one direction screeching, and the silent hawk flew in the opposite direction. If I were a little mouse, I might feel relief at hearing the loud hawk fly away, and if I relaxed my guard I might not notice the silent hawk flying right over me! The hawks taught me a way to use deception while hunting. They also taught me to question my assumptions.

#### The Second Core Spiritual Practice: Giving My Sacred Gifts

Through the nature connection practices, I learned so many ways each creature contributes to the web of life, but I had never wondered what my contribution could be. No one had ever told me this before, but I learned that each human also has sacred gifts to give. It only makes sense, since we're divine creatures like everything else in Creation.

Once again, every single healthy culture I studied recognized this to be true. Tony Ten Fingers described a Lakota phrase, "mitakuye oyasin," loosely meaning "everything is my relative." Ten Fingers' elders also taught him a deeper meaning: "I have a burning desire in my heart to know how I fit into the Creation which is one living being." Nancy Basket described the traditional Cherokee understanding: "Each lifetime you come with a medicine, a purpose that only you can get done. If you don't get it done, it won't get done. That's how important each person is. What is it that you love to do?"

Each person has sacred gifts, a life purpose, a way they make the world a better place -- and only they can do it! All of Creation is simply divine creatures giving their gifts. That includes humans cultivating and giving our sacred gifts too. I believe that giving one's sacred gifts fully is how a person gives their deepest love. "Giving my sacred gifts" and "giving my deepest love" are the same thing. Thus, training a person to give their sacred gifts trains them to give their deepest love in life, and to be their best self.

Some people have a special calling to enrich the soil, find food during lean times, or mentor children. Others are fighters who protect their people, or mediators who resolve conflict, or historians who keep ancient stories alive. I learned that it's up to each of us to find our sacred gift or gifts and our own unique way of making the world a better place. Ten Fingers also noted that it's each of our responsibility to help each other find their gifts, since sometimes a person can struggle to discover them on their own.

These practices of gratitude and gift-giving are beautiful, and it was the third spiritual practice I found that tied them all together.

#### The Third Core Spiritual Practice: Living in Reciprocity

Many healthy cultures like the Ashaninka, Cherokee, and Potawatomi remain alive around the world, even if many are not able to live in a traditional way. At one point I noticed something interesting: they keep showing up in the news. Often when some environmental catastrophe occurs or a selfish corporation threatens to pollute the Earth, I notice people of healthy cultures standing in solidarity with the land.

The Sioux led the Dakota Access Pipeline protests in 2016 in North America, seeking to protect the water from oil spills. In 2010, the Indian government evicted many Jenu Kuruba people from their ancestral land, supposedly to protect local populations of endangered tigers. The Jenu Kuruba noted that the tiger population was so high where they lived precisely because they worship the tigers, as well as the other nonhumans. The Jenu Kuruba demanded to be allowed to return and that the Indian government stop giving mining companies leases on their homeland.

In Africa, the Mbuti likewise rejected a government so-called "conservation" effort that tried to force them off the land even while companies came to dig for gold. One hunter named Mapenzi said, "We know how to protect our forest because nobody knows it the way we do. We know where the animals give birth, where they sleep and during which periods one must never kill them... The animals that the modern law wants to conserve are already under our customary protection. These are the laws our ancestors established." The Gumbaynggirr in Australia and Sami in northern Europe work to prevent logging the old-growth forests.[xxx-NOTE: duplicate from earlier chapters]

In South America, the Yuracares, Tchimanes and other cultures work to prevent the destruction of their forests in the TIPNIS region of Bolivia, where the government wants to allow illegal road development, monocrop farming, and deforestation. In northern Asia, the Evenk, Nivkh, and other cultures work to stop destructive Russian oil and gas extraction activities.

Everywhere I looked, I noticed healthy cultures were standing in solidarity with the Earth, even putting their lives on the line if need be. Eventually I understood this as the third core spiritual practice: living in reciprocity. This means I have a responsibility to give back to all the beings who give so much to me. It is not merely a nice idea; it is a core practice for individuals and groups who take responsibility for giving back to all the beings who give humans so much.

In her book _Braiding Sweetgrass_, Robin Kimmerer noted how any culture of gratitude must incorporate reciprocity too, saying, "Each person, human or no, is bound to every other in a reciprocal relationship. Just as all beings have a duty to me, I have a duty to them." If I receive meat from an animal, I am bound to support the animal or its family. When I eat corn, I have a responsibility to take care of the soil it grows in. When I receive a river's gift of clear water, I am responsible for caring for the river. Kimmerer noted that learning and practicing these responsibilities is "an integral part of a human's education."[xxx-duplicate with sacred responsibility chapter]

I think of spirituality as "how a person relates to themselves and the world." Is there an authoritarian god-figure scaring everyone into obedience? Or is the world just a bunch of molecules moving around aimlessly? Or are we all divine beings, and it really matters how each of us shows up in life? The three core spiritual practices are spiritual because they teach people how to relate to the world: with practical, aware gratitude, by giving their deepest love, and living in reciprocity.

Is it any wonder that nations which embrace these spiritual practices are able to maintain respectful relations among the people, and between people and the Earth?

#### How Can Everyone Be Divine If Some People Act with Cruelty and Selfishness?

So are humans inherently selfish or inherently generous? Or does it depend on the person or culture? I believe divinity speaks through each person's heart. Each person has a life purpose, or sacred gifts to give, and the divine force in each of our hearts can help us know what that is if a person will only listen. And when people act on that divine voice -- when a person offers their sacred gifts, acting with integrity, generosity, courage, awareness, authenticity, joy, and other beautiful qualities -- then the person is acting with an open heart, offering their deepest love. The more a person learns to "hold back" or "shut down" parts of themselves, the more they're closing their heart to that divine voice. The ones who hold back the most are often called "cold-hearted" or said to have "hearts of stone." In other words, they don't listen to that divine voice inside them that all people have, and so they act selfishly instead.

Don Cox was a black American revolutionary leader in the Black Panthers, and his mother taught him this attitude. Cox said, "Mama was a saint. She taught me that there were no bad people in the world, only those who made mistakes or stumbled along the path of righteousness. That naïve simplicity touched me to the marrow..." Martin Luther King Jr was a black American civil rights leader, and in a public speech on the night before he was assassinated, he reflected on the people who wanted to kill him because he stood up for his people: "What would happen to me from some of our sick white brothers? Well, I don't know what will happen now... I just want to do God's will..." 

These attitudes reflect the same basic truth: no one is inherently bad, but some people have a sickness, or stumble on a good path. And some people get real sick and cause huge amounts of unnecessary suffering.

Many religions and ideologies of unhealthy cultures encourage that sickness, that heart-closure, or that stumbling. They train people to think selfishness is good, or humans are born disconnected from god, or we're inclined to sin and inherently bad, or we can't trust our instincts and feelings and neighbors. Almost everyone in unhealthy cultures learns to "hold back" or "shut down" parts of themselves or ignore some parts of reality to get along in their unhealthy culture.

No one is inherently bad or selfish. Everyone has love to give. And no matter what's happened in the past, every moment is a fresh chance to show up in the world in a good way.
