## Chapter 4: What Happens When People Seek Justice?

Everybody is born with a sense of dignity, meaning that everybody has an _urge to stand for what's right_ for themselves and their neighbors. This is our human nature.

In healthy cultures, whenever trouble arises, I see a common response: people come together, discuss the problem, and consider how to respond collectively so they can return to that respectful way of life that all humans expect from birth.

Can you imagine what it would be like to receive endless disrespect, and not be legally allowed to do anything meaningful about it?

What if politicians kept giving money to the rich while many people went hungry or lived a precarious life? What if rich businessmen illegally used violent thugs to suppress your and your coworkers' efforts to get safe working conditions, and the police let them get away with it? What if someone you loved were falsely convicted of a crime, and the racist or sexist judge showed no interest in real justice?

These same kinds of problems happen in the United States, Spain, Russia, China, Egypt, and every unhealthy culture around the world. When people come together and seek justice, what do they find?

It turns out, in all these unhealthy cultures, they see a similar response.

In Venezuela, people standing up for themselves and seeking justice see this:

In communist China, they see this:

And in the capitalist United States, they see this:

I was taught growing up that the police's job is to keep people safe and enforce the law. But the riot police consistently protect the rich and powerful no matter how much they've broken the law.

And who are the police protecting the rich and powerful from? Of course, from  people angry about low wages, pollution, corruption, wars based on lies, and all the usual injustices in unhealthy cultures. The police's actual job is to scare people away from standing up for themselves, and punish people for collectively seeking justice.

Is it any wonder there's corruption when people aren't allowed to uphold their own laws and hold their leaders accountable?

All this seemed normal and natural until I found healthy cultures where people don't live this way. Every single human feels a deep urge to stand up for what's right in their culture, and unhealthy cultures essentially train people from childhood to "hold back" or "shut down" parts of themselves so they won't honor this urge to stand for what's right. In healthy cultures, I believe that standing for what's right in solidarity with neighbors is not just encouraged -- it's expected. Everyone agrees on their laws, and everyone is expected to uphold them to ensure they can maintain a respectful way of life.

Can you imagine living in a culture where everyone accepts responsibility to stand for what's right and uphold their laws, each person acting in solidarity with everyone else to ensure that no one is mistreated?

### The Nootka Stand in Solidarity

In the book _Daughters of Copper Woman_, a Nootka storyteller described a cultural technique the Nootka used to help people see their own foolish behavior: clowns. One story about a clown shows what it's like when everyone in a culture stands in solidarity to ensure no one is mistreated.

Now, these weren't clowns with big noses and bright costumes, and they didn't just act silly. Clowns were like magazine opinion writers who commented on all sorts of things. If a clown thought that the council was about to do something foolish, they might show up at council and imitate one of the leader's every moves so that "every little wart on that person would show, every hole in their idea would suddenly look real big."

If a person were vain about their clothes, a clown might follow behind them wearing tattered rags and their hair would be like a bird's nest full of mud and sticks, all looking similar to the vain person. If a person had a bad temper, a clown might follow and have fits, hitting the sand with a rock or insulting birds and generally looking foolish. If a person became self-important, the clown might follow along babbling like a baby, "until you finally heard what an ass you were bein'." And if a clown started being mean or pushy, a second clown might follow along and let the first clown see how they were showing up.

The Nootka storyteller noted, "nobody would ever dare blow up at the clown!" Anyone who did would be shamed. Clowns did not make fun of people or act hurtfully. They helped people see what they looked like to others and how silly it was to put so much emphasis on unimportant things like clothes or jewelry, "instead of what counts, like bein' nice to people, and bein' lovin'..."

Christians arrived and started dividing up the land. They set up a church, and began trying to get the Nootka to attend, offering mirrors and other trinkets as enticements. At church, the preacher told them what to wear, how to live, and what to do. He insisted that men shouldn't wear kilts, and women should only have long dresses that covered them completely. He kept saying that everyone should live and dress like the white man.

One day, a clown from a nearby community arrived at the church. Like the white man, she wore a big black hat and a black jacket. She even wore old rundown shoes someone had thrown away. Unlike the white man, she wore nothing else. 

She moved to the front and waited for church to start.

The preacher got very upset, but everyone else looked at her respectfully. No one mocked her or looked away to avoid her nakedness.

The preacher started ranting about nudity, naked women, sin, and respect for God. Then he came down from his pulpit and grabbed the clown to throw her out!

Acting violently towards a clown was absolutely not allowed, and the storyteller said, "The people just about ripped him apart." But the clown protected him from the crowd, went up to where the preacher had been, and began speaking.

The clown first encouraged empathy, asking people to imagine how a stranger might feel, being away from home and surrounded by people who looked and acted differently. Then she reminded her neighbors of the beauty of their respectful way of life when she said, "there was more than one kind of mirror. There was the white man's mirror that you got if you went to church, but there was the mirror in the eyes of the people you loved..." She warned the crowd about following anybody "who was so mixed up they'd do forbidden things." The clown walked out of the church, and all the people followed her, leaving the preacher alone. That church still exists and remains empty to this day.

I feel impressed that this woman calmly but clearly confronted the preacher's hurtful attitudes. She even invited her neighbors to have compassion for a stranger after he'd acted rudely. I also feel impressed that the people immediately recognized who was in the right and acted in support of the mostly-naked woman instead of the self-righteous man. This story showed me that whole communities can act in solidarity and stand for a culture of mutual respect when conflict arises.

This story showed me what it's like when everyone in a culture upholds the rules for how people treat each other. The Nootka didn't have police; everybody took a stand to protect the clown when she was attacked. They had rules that worked for everyone, and everyone upheld them.

This solidarity could only exist if neighbors act generously with each other. If selfishness were widespread, it would be hard for people to trust each other to stand for what's right, even at great personal risk. How do unhealthy cultures encourage widespread selfishness? And how do healthy cultures maintain a way of life that rewards generosity instead, each in their own way? To explore, join me in _Chapter 5: Gift Economy Vs Profit Economy_.
