## Cultivating Bravery with Others
* each person must be held to a high standard _on their own terms_. Meaning:

1. Ask them what their goals are. If you suspect they're dreaming small and choosing too-easy goals, share your concerns and ask them to either assuage your doubts or choose better goals that will really lead to personal growth.

2. Ask what standards they want to be held to. Do not hold them to your standards, which may be different. If you think they're choosing weak standards, share your concerns as in step 1.

I have struggled to begin successful accountability groups because people were afraid of being judged by others' standards instead of their own. For example, I once invited a homosexual friend to be part of a men's group once, and he liked the format and valued personal growth, but worried about being the only homosexual man and didn't want ignorant heterosexual men holding him to standards that didn't make sense, or might even be offensive.

So, again, the group should ask each individual what their goals and standards are, and then help hold them accountable.

## Stay Present With the Discomfort

* these exercises only help if you stay present with the discomfort - if you ignore how cold you feel, you'll only slightly increase your cold tolerance and won't get more brave. If you feel the cold and practice relaxing into it, and even getting excited about it, then your cold tolerance will grow more rapidly as will your bravery.
