### Part 1: What are healthy cultures like?

#### Introducing Healthy Cultures and Three Core Spiritual Practices

##### 1. First chapter exploration: do healthy cultures exist?
  * yes - found the Ashaninka

##### 2. There are lots of cultures as beautiful as the Ashaninka - what do they have in common?
  * three core spiritual practices
  * open heart - each person gives their deepest love every day, from gratitude, in service of what most matters to them.
  * remembering - Prechtel on Culture of Remembering, and forgetting divinity and their divine place in it -> citizens

#### 2nd Core Spiritual Practice (giving)

##### 3. Gift economy
  * when each person trained to give their love every day and stand in solidarity with their neighbors, and when they don't allow selfishness to take hold, what kind of economy results?
  * add: Tzutujil Mayans didn't have word for "door" much less lock
  * also include stories of women spreading abundance from sex discrim/equality chapter

##### 4. Sexual Freedom, Whole Nations with Open Heart (from open/closed heart chap)

#### 3rd Core Spiritual Practice (reciprocity)

##### 5. Nature Connection / Service: Gift economy extended to non-humans
  * pull from chap 9 and land chapter (acting in service of the land)

##### 6. Boundary-setting and conflict resolution - solidarity
  * I'd only ever lived in or visited cultures with police, prisons, and imposed law. How do people live in a respectful way with each other without these things? What happens when trouble arises? (Weston Price, Jesuit Missionaries and me all noticed no police+prisons)
    * Ben Franklin (Haud chapter), Huron, Weston Price, me -- all noticed no police/prisons
  * what personal qualities do they emphasize to maintain these boundaries/agreements (agreements+integrity)
  * selfishness seen as core element to avoid
  * shared agreements/accountability
  * why there'd be no racism or sexism within the culture -- when everyone takes a responsibility to stand for what's right, there's no room for that nonsense

#### 1st Core Spiritual Practice (practical aware gratitude)

##### 7. Choosing leaders that serve the people because everyone takes responsibility for choosing good leaders
  * leaders arise from the cultural context: cultures that allow selfishness commonly wind up with selfish leaders, and the rich overthrow the generous ones. cultures that encourage generosity wind up with generous leaders
  * red cloud story
  * gracious receiving - look out for good leaders and lift them up
  * balanced leadership - from sexual discrim/equality chapter
  * Haudenosaunee example - spiritual leaders = political leaders, and involved leadership process that starts with women

#### Putting it all together

##### 8. Haudenosaunee Chapter as case study
  * leave out Peacemaker story
  * include leader-choosing piece from sexual equality/discrimination chapter

### Part 2: why don't we have healthy cultures?

#### Forgetting (from hate chapter)
* __from hate chapter__: we're trained not to know that respectful cultures exist, and even to fear/hate/look down on them or think they died out long ago

* __from blind belief 2__: trained not to know our own history (ie garden of eden) or our spiritual leaders (ie jesus christ)

* __from priv 4-entitlements__: common for activists to notice this pattern around sex, race, or class and try to address it - same as what this book is doing.

#### Economies that reward selfishness and create dependency and desperation

* __from profit economies__: selfishness training

  * intentionally creating financial dependency + desperation

* __from cascading generosity/selfishness__: gift economy debt vs profit economy debt

#### Deep training to close our hearts

* __selfishness__: pro-selfish narratives (great scam), profit economies
* __cowardice training__: solidarity forbidden (only law enforcers can enforce the law; peace activists punished; etc)
* __low integrity__: see police for example (what happens when people stand up for what's right?)
* __shame__: 
  * examples from great scam of heart-closing cultural narratives
  * moralistic upbringings - sex
* __isolation/disconnection__:
  * land ownership
* __dependency on money/land/etc rather than neighbors+Earth__ (world-shaping)
  * same planet different worlds
  * rulers shape lives of millions
  * nature disconnection (from gift economy/profit economy)
* __lazy thinking__: assumptions, propaganda
* __privilege__
  * lift-and-turn
  * social class + promise-keeping
  * entitlement
* __rejecting pleasure and connection__
  * child abuse and deprivation
  * sexual shaming/division
* __poor health__ (contrast w/good health of healthy cultures) - chap 45
* __normalizing abuse__ (from training people to adopt authoritarian ideologies)
  * trained not to notice that some people are controlling/manipulating everyone else, or to think it's appropriate and then misinterpret the hurtful consequences

#### Sabotaging cultural healing
* culture jamming
* endless predation
* sabotaging social movements
* propaganda
* racism/sexism/hatred
* deepest lessons from spiritual leaders

### Part 3: what can people do to create a healthy culture?

#### Integrity chapter

#### Bravery chapter

#### Good contact vs poor contact

#### Sacred fem

#### Sacred Circles

#### Sacred masc

#### Case study in deep revolution: Zapatista chapter

### More notes

#### Common elements of healthy cultures (items to include early on)
* everyone stands for culture of mutual respect
* respect between people, and between people and the Earth is the norm
  * no racism/sexism within the culture
* no one rules over anyone else
* selfishness not tolerated
* economy that rewards generosity rather than selfishness
* leaders people actually respect
* Three core spiritual practices - everyone takes responsibility
* invite each person to live with an open heart / give their love every day (2nd core spiritual practice)

Many people can imagine life without a boss or rulers -- that is, without taking orders or doing unsatisfying work. But how can people maintain a culture without selfishness? What personal qualities are needed for people to participate in a healthy culture? What responsibilities does everyone have to choose a leader that serves the people, or to maintain a gift economy? What's it like to live with an open heart, giving one's love every day?

* many have forgotten that give economies are even possible

* people who've forgotten that leaders truly can serve the people -- if the people show up right

### Outline Overview 

Flow in 3 parts:
1) what are healthy cultures like?
  * my exploration -- how can humans live in a good way?
2) why don't we have healthy cultures?
  * my exploration -- what keeps us from living in this way now?  
  * big shift: recognizing there are rulers, that many problems don't spontaneously arise in a group of people, but are imposed or encouraged -- how?
3) what can we do to create healthy cultures?
  * lessons I've learned -- what does the path to a healthy culture look like for people trapped in unhealthy cultures?

heart-openness in first 1/3: what's it like to be in a culture that welcomes our love every day?
heart-closure middle 1/3 - what's it like to be in a culture that doesn't welcome our love?
heart-opening last 1/3: personal and collective path to generate a healthy culture

***
Thoughts about this: 
  * would be nice if it were in order of the 3 core spiritual practices.

### Chapters that still need categorizing
* family and burglar
* endless nightmare descends on healthy culture (Columbus/Arawaks)
* Harriet Tubman
* Culture of Remembering / Rainbow
* When Children take responsibility
