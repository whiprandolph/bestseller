I've never been part of a deep revolution, but I've found stories of people who have. where people created new healthy cultures in the midst of violence so they could live in a good way again.

Pull from Basic Call to Consciousness / Chap 31 and Zapatistas / Chap 40.

Practical, Aware Gratitude:
* awareness
* receiving the gifts of the Earth: food, medicine, shelter, life lessons

Giving my Sacred Gifts
* integrity/authenticity/joy/etc - sacred urges

integrity

    * okanagan enowkwinwix (sp?)
initiative

* All these are actually different facets of an integrated person. Bravery and integrity aren't different. Bravery is a person's willingness to show up with integrity no matter what. 


we have a way of life that results in all these things - results in the death of our spiritual leaders, results in racism and greed and pollution and corruption. We've been trained by ruling classes across centuries to tolerate having rulers. Of course we will need courage to cultivate a different way of life - new in some ways, ancient in other ways.
