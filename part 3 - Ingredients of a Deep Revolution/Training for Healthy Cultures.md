## Final Chapter

### Training in unhealthy cultures is opposite of what's needed for healthy cultures

* Ignore disrespect/abuse instead of acknowledging it and responding. Ignoring one political party's corruption while pointing out another. Pretending prostitutes are acting on evil sexual urges instead of financial desperation. Pretending people are free when they're not. 

* money dependency instead of Earth interdependency
* selfishness instead of generosity
* high trust & integrity instead of low
* deep awareness instead of low
* conection with Earth, service of Earth instead of disconnection/exploitation
* dignity instead of shame
* solidarity to stand for what's right in service of one's people, not isolation or institutional solidarity to get rich or serve authorities or avoid punishment (ie companies often have pretend solidarity; police have pretend solidarity)
