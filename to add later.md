## From three core spirit practices chap
I believe that Creator and Creation are not separate. Creation is a manifestation of Creator. In other words, all of life is a manifestation of God or Goddess or Allah. Creator is like a woman. Women are life, and women also create life: women are life creating life. In the same way, Creation and Creator are the same. And that means that people who stand in solidarity with the Earth are standing in solidarity with God.

After studying many different religions, it seems like humans keep looking for words to describe the indescribable. It may be called Allah, Goddess, Divinity, Creator, God, Yahweh, Spirit That Moves Through All Things, Holy Spirit, Great Mystery, and so on. And of course, some people are agnostic or atheist like I used to be.

I don't have any more insight about divinity than anyone else, but I know this: every single person has a voice in their heart that tells them how to walk a good path if only they'll listen. This is true whether a person is Muslim, Christian, Buddhist, atheist, pagan, or anything else.

And it's not just humans who have an inner knowing. Every being has a special role to play in creation, and part of relating to life in a good way is learning how to respect not just ourselves and each other, but all the life around us. Christianity, Islam, Buddhism and other religions have aspects of these ancient understandings. The goal of this book is not to impose a particular religion. The goal of this book is to distill essential attitudes and practices that anybody can embrace to live in a good way with other people and the Earth.

### Healthy vs Unhealthy Cultures: What is the Core Disease?

For years, I wondered what all these beautiful cultures have in common. In traditional stories from all these healthy cultures, just like I had seen with the Ashaninka, their children seem so capable and confident, both men and women have positions of real leadership, and they have leaders that people actually want to follow. It's normal for people to accept deep responsibility to treat each other and the Earth in a good way. Why do some cultures have these qualities, and others seem really unhealthy?

And what do all these unhealthy cultures have in common, with their racism, sexism, self-serving political leaders, pollution, and more?

Do cultures become unhealthy when the population gets too large? Some academic literature states that humans can only maintain tight knit communities of up to 150 people, a limit called "Dunbar's number."[xxx-conversation dunbar number] I commonly hear people claim that humans start behaving inappropriately towards each other in groups larger than 150, as accountability mechanisms supposedly start to break down then.

But that doesn't make sense. The Ashaninka number 2,000 and maintain a culture where everyone is treated respectfully. The Cherokee in 1674 CE numbered approximately 50,000 and likewise maintained that internal baseline of mutual respect amongst themselves.[xxx-cherokee pop and extent]

Do cultures become unhealthy when they cover too much area? That doesn't make sense either. As of the early 1700s, the Haudenosaunee Confederacy covered over 38,000 square miles.[xxx-native land map haud] This is comparable in size to Switzerland, Bhutan, or Taiwan. If the Haudenosaunee were a US state, it would be the 38th largest, between Kentucky and Indiana. Before extended European contact, the Cherokee covered approximately 40,000 sq miles.[xxx-cherokee pop and extent] Clearly humans can maintain healthy cultures that cover huge distances and include many thousands of people.

Did the trouble happen when people started farming? No, the Huron gained about 75% of the food they ate from crops they grew. They still shocked French missionaries who couldn't understand how people could get along without police, prisons, and authorities imposing law and order.[xxx-huron farmers of the north|p26]<sup>,</sup>[xxx-huron farmers of the north|p71] Even prior to contact with European colonizers, the Haudenosaunee relied more on farming than hunting for food.[xxx-encyclopedia haudenosaunee|pvii]

Sometimes people of these cultures are called native, indigenous, tribal, indian, or first nations. I call them healthy human cultures. And I have found one root difference between healthy and unhealthy human cultures:

<center>__*In healthy cultures, everyone stands for a culture of mutual respect, and nobody rules over anybody else.*__</center>

Healthy cultures have strong leaders and no rulers, so nobody imposes law on anybody else. That means everyone agrees on their rules for appropriate behavior. And when someone behaves inappropriately, anyone may take initiative to ensure that the misbehaving person is held accountable. Such healthy cultures may fight with each other, but within the culture, they maintain a baseline of mutual respect.

In unhealthy human cultures, one person or a few people rule over everyone else. Whether the rulers are kings, billionaires, imams, priests, prime ministers, or presidents, they impose laws that everyone else must follow or face severe punishment. The rulers choose how to enforce the law, and forbid everybody else from taking initiative to hold misbehaving people accountable.

Another way of putting it is this: in unhealthy cultures, a small number of people trap a large number in exploitative relationships. Rulers use all manner of tricks, traps, and childhood training to convince everyone to accept the legitimacy of their rule. Other names for an unhealthy culture include "authoritarian culture," "unfree culture," "low-accountability culture" and "abusive culture."

Having rulers creates all the other problems that anybody can see. Racism, sexism, dishonest leadership, pollution, disconnection from nature, selfishness, widespread child abuse, forgetting, and poverty are all merely _common symptoms caused by the root cultural disease where some people rule over everyone else_.

No culture is perfect. Any culture can experience trouble. Any act of disrespect is a cultural wound, and disrespect can occur in any culture. However, healthy cultures are able to address disrespect when it occurs so that it doesn't happen again, and the people can return to that baseline of mutual respect as a normal way of life.

In unhealthy cultures, when disrespect occurs, especially by authority figures, it is extremely difficult to address. Thus, it is common for disrespectful behavior to just keep happening. Unhealthy cultures are not able to remediate problems and return to a baseline of mutual respect. Unhealthy cultures are not able to heal their cultural wounds.

Living in reciprocity with each other and the Earth is who we are as humans. Living in deep gratitude and giving my sacred gifts, or living my life purpose, is who we are as humans. Different healthy cultures may recognize different gods, have different creation mythologies, or different ceremonies, but I see these three core spiritual practices in every healthy culture that I have studied.

I believe these core spiritual practices (gratitude, gift-giving, and reciprocity) are universal. In healthy cultures, people encourage each other to live out these practices every day. In unhealthy cultures, authorities make this very difficult.

How do healthy cultures create effective systems of conflict resolution and accountability? And how do authorities use the law to disrupt solidarity, discourage deep responsibility, and prevent people from holding each other accountable for inappropriate behavior?

To explore how humans can have real solidarity and accountability, and how these can be blocked, I invite you to _Chapter 3: Shared Agreements vs Imposed Laws_.

### from gift economies chap


Shamans also played this role. Whenever a shaman helped someone heal from an illness, they would give the shaman a great deal of food. The shaman would feed his family from these gifts and then give the rest away to whomever needed it most.[xxx-secrets of the talking jaguar|p248]

I witnessed a similar pattern while traveling in Peru. I was skeptical of every so-called shaman I encountered -- except one. This shaman of a local healthy culture accepted donations for holding ayahuasca ceremonies and letting visitors stay on his land. Based on the normal amount of donations, I noticed he must be living pretty well. Then I learned from an assistant that every few weeks, he took a cab into town and distributed the money to whomever needed it. When I discovered that he helped spread abundance rather than hoard it, I was willing to trust him in a way I hadn't trusted many self-anointed Peruvian shamans.

#### Jesus Christ Wanted to Create a Healthy Culture that Generated Abundance for Everyone

Christians worship Jesus Christ as the sole Son of God, and one of his defining qualities was his willingness to give up all his possessions so he could walk a spiritual path without distraction. A rich man once came to him and asked for guidance. Jesus asked if he'd followed the basic rules, including avoiding murder, theft, and lying. The rich man said he had, and what else was there? Jesus told him to give up all his possessions. The rich man declined, and Jesus exclaimed to his disciples, "How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God!" Jesus' disciples felt astonished. Jesus said, "It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God."

His disciples could hardly believe this. Almost everyone in that culture was either rich or trying to get rich. They were so used to their culture that encouraged profiting and hoarding that they asked themselves, "Who then can be saved?" I believe Jesus' own disciples worried he was putting impossible demands on people which would keep almost everyone out of Heaven, when he was actually asking for a level of sharing that would be normal in a healthy culture![xxx-bible|esv mark 10:26]

Different religious and secular leaders have used different words and imagery to try to express the same core spiritual truths. I believe "living in a utopia," "living in a healthy culture," and "living in the kingdom of God" are all the same thing. All of these describe the profound satisfaction that comes from giving one's love fully in gratitude for all the gifts one receives from humans and nonhumans, while living in a culture based on sharing rather than profiting.

Creation and Creator are one, so receiving the gifts of life with deep gratitude is the same as receiving the gifts of God -- the first core spiritual practice.

The second core spiritual practice is to give one's love fully without reservation, participating in Creation by giving one's own sacred gifts. How many people learn to withhold their love out of fear of losing their comforts, privileges, and possessions? How many more people would willingly stand up to abusive authorities or speak out against foolish racism or sexism if they were not afraid of losing their comforts and safety?

Unhealthy cultures punish people in countless ways for behaving appropriately, and this is the result: many people learn to cling to their possessions and somehow withhold their love. Since a person's love is their own manifestation of divinity (since we're all divine beings), a person withholding their love is actually withholding their own divine nature and thus disconnected from divinity.

When Jesus Christ said that a person who trusted in riches would struggle to enter the Kingdom of God, I believe this is what he was talking about. Anyone who wishes to connect deeply with Creation and Creator must choose to give their love fully rather than selfishly cling to possessions and comforts. Fearfully clinging to one's possessions prevents a person from fully giving their love. Sadly, unhealthy cultures and their profit economies encourage people to selfishly protect their possessions rather than give their love freely.

Like so many deep lessons, this practice of giving up one's possessions has nuance. Jesus Christ kept the clothes he wore. Harriet Tubman kept her gun which protected her and the runaway slaves, as explored in Chapter 16. If Jesus Christ had gone without clothes or Tubman had gone without her gun, they could not have done as much good work. When I read Ohiyesa's words that "the love of possessions is a weakness," it teaches me to act in service of what most matters to me without letting fearful attachment to my possessions get in the way. It teaches me not to let the comforts and safety of my privilege get in the way of doing meaningful work in the world.

When American Black Panthers were discussing how to reach their political goals, Don Cox suggested the basic approach: "Use what you got to get what you need."[xxx-just another nigger|use what you got] When a person selfishly clings to their possessions and avoids acting in deep service, or a person only acts in service in ways that don't put their possessions at risk, the world becomes a darker place. When a person uses possessions to do important work in the world, with their focus clearly on achieving some greater good, the world becomes brighter.

Generous sharing is who we are as humans, but unhealthy cultures make this difficult. Instead of routinely experiencing the "most secure feeling in the world" which comes from living in a gift economy, the majority of people in unhealthy cultures focus on advancing themselves, or at least surviving, in a profit economy.

How do profit economies reward selfishness, directing and consuming people's lives? The next chapter, _Chapter 10: Profit Economies_, reveals what happens when rulers and their selfishness take hold.

#### Stories of Women Spreading Abundance (from chap 24)

I found many beautiful stories of women contributing to their healthy cultures by redistributing abundance. Jesuit missionaries stayed with the Montagnais-Naskapi and noticed that men left household affairs almost entirely up to the women. Regardless how much food he or she brought in, it never lasted long because she commonly shared the food with everyone. Paul Le Jeune wrote, "I have never seen my host ask a giddy young woman that he had with him what became of the provisions, although they were disappearing very fast."[xxx-commodity exchange and subordination]

Huron women likewise pooled their food in common storage so there would be enough for everyone.[xxx-huron farmers of the north|p28]

Nancy Basket described the traditional role of the Cherokee gigau (GIG-ah-oo), meaning beloved woman. A woman was chosen to be gigau because she was especially kind, fair and wise. Her job was to make sure all the collective food sources were stored well so there would be enough for everybody. Basket described the goal: "The Cherokee, if we all had a lot, then everybody had a lot. If there wasn't a whole lot, then no one had a whole lot." The gigau had another role too. If the council could not agree on whether to go to war, and they were split down the middle, the gigau would cast the deciding vote.[xxx-basket interview]

Basket described another way that women redistributed goods. In one ceremony, all the women would honor the oldest woman in town by bringing her gifts. They knew she didn't need all the stuff, but they trusted that she would know where the goods needed to go. This old woman would then distribute the gifts to whomever needed them the most.

When I lived briefly with the Ashaninka, women's willingness to share their wealth seemed magical to me. At every single house I visited, a woman graciously shared food and drink, and she invited me and my fellow travelers to rest. There was never any payment. I had to find other ways to give back.
