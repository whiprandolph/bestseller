## From three core spirit practices chap
I believe that Creator and Creation are not separate. Creation is a manifestation of Creator. In other words, all of life is a manifestation of God or Goddess or Allah. Creator is like a woman. Women are life, and women also create life: women are life creating life. In the same way, Creation and Creator are the same. And that means that people who stand in solidarity with the Earth are standing in solidarity with God.

After studying many different religions, it seems like humans keep looking for words to describe the indescribable. It may be called Allah, Goddess, Divinity, Creator, God, Yahweh, Spirit That Moves Through All Things, Holy Spirit, Great Mystery, and so on. And of course, some people are agnostic or atheist like I used to be.

I don't have any more insight about divinity than anyone else, but I know this: every single person has a voice in their heart that tells them how to walk a good path if only they'll listen. This is true whether a person is Muslim, Christian, Buddhist, atheist, pagan, or anything else.

And it's not just humans who have an inner knowing. Every being has a special role to play in creation, and part of relating to life in a good way is learning how to respect not just ourselves and each other, but all the life around us. Christianity, Islam, Buddhism and other religions have aspects of these ancient understandings. The goal of this book is not to impose a particular religion. The goal of this book is to distill essential attitudes and practices that anybody can embrace to live in a good way with other people and the Earth.

### from gift economies chap


Shamans also played this role. Whenever a shaman helped someone heal from an illness, they would give the shaman a great deal of food. The shaman would feed his family from these gifts and then give the rest away to whomever needed it most.[xxx-secrets of the talking jaguar|p248]

I witnessed a similar pattern while traveling in Peru. I was skeptical of every so-called shaman I encountered -- except one. This shaman of a local healthy nation accepted donations for holding ayahuasca ceremonies and letting visitors stay on his land. Based on the normal amount of donations, I noticed he must be living pretty well. Then I learned from an assistant that every few weeks, he took a cab into town and distributed the money to whomever needed it. When I discovered that he helped spread abundance rather than hoard it, I was willing to trust him in a way I hadn't trusted many self-anointed Peruvian shamans.

#### Stories of Women Spreading Abundance (from chap 24)

I found many beautiful stories of women contributing to their healthy nations by redistributing abundance. Jesuit missionaries stayed with the Montagnais-Naskapi and noticed that men left household affairs almost entirely up to the women. Regardless how much food he or she brought in, it never lasted long because she commonly shared the food with everyone. Paul Le Jeune wrote, "I have never seen my host ask a giddy young woman that he had with him what became of the provisions, although they were disappearing very fast."[xxx-commodity exchange and subordination]

Huron women likewise pooled their food in common storage so there would be enough for everyone.[xxx-huron farmers of the north|p28]

Nancy Basket described the traditional role of the Cherokee gigau (GIG-ah-oo), meaning beloved woman. A woman was chosen to be gigau because she was especially kind, fair and wise. Her job was to make sure all the collective food sources were stored well so there would be enough for everybody. Basket described the goal: "The Cherokee, if we all had a lot, then everybody had a lot. If there wasn't a whole lot, then no one had a whole lot." The gigau had another role too. If the council could not agree on whether to go to war, and they were split down the middle, the gigau would cast the deciding vote.[xxx-basket interview]

Basket described another way that women redistributed goods. In one ceremony, all the women would honor the oldest woman in town by bringing her gifts. They knew she didn't need all the stuff, but they trusted that she would know where the goods needed to go. This old woman would then distribute the gifts to whomever needed them the most.

When I lived briefly with the Ashaninka, women's willingness to share their wealth seemed magical to me. At every single house I visited, a woman graciously shared food and drink, and she invited me and my fellow travelers to rest. There was never any payment. I had to find other ways to give back.

Human cultures are living organisms. Like lions, trees, ant colonies, and other organisms, when human cultures get wounded, they try to heal.

Any act of disrespect between two people is a cultural wound. Healthy nations respond to disrespect by addressing it and finding a way back to that baseline of mutual respect. This is what it means for people to take responsibility for each other and the culture's wellbeing: instead of ignoring or excusing the hurtful behavior, they address the issue. Cultural healing occurs when people address disrespect so that it stops happening.

Priscilla Settee, a woman of the Cree people, described their reconciliation process where elders would consider how to bring a person "back into a balanced life" and help them "focus on what is important in life." Instead of believing that a troubled person is bad and deserves punishment, this more loving approach recognizes that the troubled person is basically good but off-balanced or missing something important. The goal is to help them recover their balance.

Megan Biesele and Ju/'hoan San man Kxao =Oma (these punctuation symbols refer to sounds that don't exist in English) described the Ju/'hoan San healing dances where "they try to put these two people next to each other so that they can come into harmony by dancing together... What people have told me about what's going on in these beautiful dances is that it's a technology of opening the heart so that healing energy can enter and so that people's hearts will be revealed to each other and any problems or enmity will go out from between them."

Even more serious injury or even accidental killing can be resolved in a way that is satisfying to everyone involved.
