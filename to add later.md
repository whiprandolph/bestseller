## From three core spirit practices chap
I believe that Creator and Creation are not separate. Creation is a manifestation of Creator. In other words, all of life is a manifestation of God or Goddess or Allah. Creator is like a woman. Women are life, and women also create life: women are life creating life. In the same way, Creation and Creator are the same. And that means that people who stand in solidarity with the Earth are standing in solidarity with God.

After studying many different religions, it seems like humans keep looking for words to describe the indescribable. It may be called Allah, Goddess, Divinity, Creator, God, Yahweh, Spirit That Moves Through All Things, Holy Spirit, Great Mystery, and so on. And of course, some people are agnostic or atheist like I used to be.

I don't have any more insight about divinity than anyone else, but I know this: every single person has a voice in their heart that tells them how to walk a good path if only they'll listen. This is true whether a person is Muslim, Christian, Buddhist, atheist, pagan, or anything else.

And it's not just humans who have an inner knowing. Every being has a special role to play in creation, and part of relating to life in a good way is learning how to respect not just ourselves and each other, but all the life around us. Christianity, Islam, Buddhism and other religions have aspects of these ancient understandings. The goal of this book is not to impose a particular religion. The goal of this book is to distill essential attitudes and practices that anybody can embrace to live in a good way with other people and the Earth.

### Healthy vs Unhealthy Cultures: What is the Core Disease?

For years, I wondered what all these beautiful cultures have in common. In traditional stories from all these healthy cultures, just like I had seen with the Ashaninka, their children seem so capable and confident, both men and women have positions of real leadership, and they have leaders that people actually want to follow. It's normal for people to accept deep responsibility to treat each other and the Earth in a good way. Why do some cultures have these qualities, and others seem really unhealthy?

And what do all these unhealthy cultures have in common, with their racism, sexism, self-serving political leaders, pollution, and more?

Do cultures become unhealthy when the population gets too large? Some academic literature states that humans can only maintain tight knit communities of up to 150 people, a limit called "Dunbar's number."[xxx-conversation dunbar number] I commonly hear people claim that humans start behaving inappropriately towards each other in groups larger than 150, as accountability mechanisms supposedly start to break down then.

But that doesn't make sense. The Ashaninka number 2,000 and maintain a culture where everyone is treated respectfully. The Cherokee in 1674 CE numbered approximately 50,000 and likewise maintained that internal baseline of mutual respect amongst themselves.[xxx-cherokee pop and extent]

Do cultures become unhealthy when they cover too much area? That doesn't make sense either. As of the early 1700s, the Haudenosaunee Confederacy covered over 38,000 square miles.[xxx-native land map haud] This is comparable in size to Switzerland, Bhutan, or Taiwan. If the Haudenosaunee were a US state, it would be the 38th largest, between Kentucky and Indiana. Before extended European contact, the Cherokee covered approximately 40,000 sq miles.[xxx-cherokee pop and extent] Clearly humans can maintain healthy cultures that cover huge distances and include many thousands of people.

Did the trouble happen when people started farming? No, the Huron gained about 75% of the food they ate from crops they grew. They still shocked French missionaries who couldn't understand how people could get along without police, prisons, and authorities imposing law and order.[xxx-huron farmers of the north|p26]<sup>,</sup>[xxx-huron farmers of the north|p71] Even prior to contact with European colonizers, the Haudenosaunee relied more on farming than hunting for food.[xxx-encyclopedia haudenosaunee|pvii]

Sometimes people of these cultures are called native, indigenous, tribal, indian, or first nations. I call them healthy human cultures. And I have found one root difference between healthy and unhealthy human cultures:

<center>__*In healthy cultures, everyone stands for a culture of mutual respect, and nobody rules over anybody else.*__</center>

Healthy cultures have strong leaders and no rulers, so nobody imposes law on anybody else. That means everyone agrees on their rules for appropriate behavior. And when someone behaves inappropriately, anyone may take initiative to ensure that the misbehaving person is held accountable. Such healthy cultures may fight with each other, but within the culture, they maintain a baseline of mutual respect.

In unhealthy human cultures, one person or a few people rule over everyone else. Whether the rulers are kings, billionaires, imams, priests, prime ministers, or presidents, they impose laws that everyone else must follow or face severe punishment. The rulers choose how to enforce the law, and forbid everybody else from taking initiative to hold misbehaving people accountable.

Another way of putting it is this: in unhealthy cultures, a small number of people trap a large number in exploitative relationships. Rulers use all manner of tricks, traps, and childhood training to convince everyone to accept the legitimacy of their rule. Other names for an unhealthy culture include "authoritarian culture," "unfree culture," "low-accountability culture" and "abusive culture."

Having rulers creates all the other problems that anybody can see. Racism, sexism, dishonest leadership, pollution, disconnection from nature, selfishness, widespread child abuse, forgetting, and poverty are all merely _common symptoms caused by the root cultural disease where some people rule over everyone else_.

No culture is perfect. Any culture can experience trouble. Any act of disrespect is a cultural wound, and disrespect can occur in any culture. However, healthy cultures are able to address disrespect when it occurs so that it doesn't happen again, and the people can return to that baseline of mutual respect as a normal way of life.

In unhealthy cultures, when disrespect occurs, especially by authority figures, it is extremely difficult to address. Thus, it is common for disrespectful behavior to just keep happening. Unhealthy cultures are not able to remediate problems and return to a baseline of mutual respect. Unhealthy cultures are not able to heal their cultural wounds.

Living in reciprocity with each other and the Earth is who we are as humans. Living in deep gratitude and giving my sacred gifts, or living my life purpose, is who we are as humans. Different healthy cultures may recognize different gods, have different creation mythologies, or different ceremonies, but I see these three core spiritual practices in every healthy culture that I have studied.

I believe these core spiritual practices (gratitude, gift-giving, and reciprocity) are universal. In healthy cultures, people encourage each other to live out these practices every day. In unhealthy cultures, authorities make this very difficult.

How do healthy cultures create effective systems of conflict resolution and accountability? And how do authorities use the law to disrupt solidarity, discourage deep responsibility, and prevent people from holding each other accountable for inappropriate behavior?

To explore how humans can have real solidarity and accountability, and how these can be blocked, I invite you to _Chapter 3: Shared Agreements vs Imposed Laws_.
