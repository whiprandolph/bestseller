### Respectful Harvest -- Living as a Gift to the Land

When there is no land ownership, it is much easier to enrich the Earth as a normal, default way of life. Instead of planting trees or gardens as a hobby or a job separate from the rest of a person's life, the Earth's needs can be fully integrated into every decision.

Robin Kimmerer described how Potawatomi people have a long history of making baskets from black ash trees. Traditional tree harvesters recognize each tree as an individual, nonhuman person. A respectful harvest begins with a request. The tree cutter describes their purpose and asks the tree for permission to be harvested and listens carefully for a response, which is sometimes no. Perhaps something in the surroundings, such as a bird's nest or close neighbor explains why the tree declined to be harvested, or perhaps the person just knows. Either way, the respectful harvester keeps asking trees until they hear a yes. Then they offer a prayer and gift of tobacco before cutting down the tree with great care not to damage its trunk or tree neighbors.[xxx-braiding sweetgrass|wisgaak gokpenagen]

Traditional Potawatomi harvesters are very aware of their impact on the black ash, and they became worried when its populations began declining. Basket-making has been a huge part of their culture and livelihood. Could the decline be due to overharvesting?

Kimmerer and an assistant investigated, identifying all the black ashes and their ages in their region in New York State. Ultimately they found that black ash tree populations were dropping in some areas and rising in others, and they found that black ashes were actually thriving wherever there were traditional Potawatomi basket makers. Black ash trees need open space in the canopy to thrive; saplings die in full shade. Basket makers opened up the canopy occasionally as they harvested black ash. Where the basket makers no longer harvested, the canopy remained closed and black ash numbers declined.

Humans thus benefited from the black ash, and the black ash benefited from humans. New generations of black ash thrived wherever people respectfully harvested it. This sort of respectful harvest would be impossible if people were confined only to land that they "owned." A respectful harvester could ask permission to enter another person's land, but if they did not receive permission, that would be the end of their basket making, and black ash populations would decline even further.

Tom Brown Jr, heavily mentored by the Apache man Stalking Wolf, learned how to respectfully harvest a tree to make a bow. Pioneers had usually searched for a straight, tall sapling and harvested it without considering what impact its removal would have on the land. They might harvest several trees, more than they needed, and discard a few. In their ignorance, they might not even recognize what makes a good tree for a bow. Pioneers often chose trees growing in the open, unaware that trees with an easy life and thus consistent growth rings produced poor bows.

Stalking Wolf pointed out that, like people, trees with an easy life lacked strength. The trees that struggled to survive and reach the sun developed tight growth rings, leading to a bow that could generate much more power.

Stalking Wolf said that he and people like him would wander through a forest guided more by their heart than their mind, and he commonly passed many fine saplings. He looked for a grove of saplings in heavy competition for the sun. He then might spend days searching that grove for just the right sapling. He would verify that removing the tree would benefit the surrounding grove. Once he picked such a tree, he would pray to the tree and Creator, explaining how the sapling would be used and how his people would honor the sacrifice. He said how much the sapling would be cherished, and it would be made into an excellent bow that would become an extension of the hunter, not just an inanimate tool. Stalking Wolf recognized that removing the sapling would be good for the grove as well as good for the people whom he served by hunting, and when he received permission from the tree and Creator, he would harvest the tree.

Brown and his friend heard Stalking Wolf talk about deciding who should live and die, and this sounded like playing God. They didn't like that. But Stalking Wolf pointed out that humans have to take other creatures' lives to survive, and that is ok as long as harvesting is done in a respectful way that has a positive impact on the land.[xxx-the vision|p80]

Like the Potawatomi basket-makers, Stalking Wolf studied a large forested area before selecting a tree such that its removal benefited both the forest and the toolmaker. If he had been confined to harvesting a tree on land he owned in a system of land ownership, this respectful harvest would not have been possible, and both humans and the forest would have suffered.

These stories show me how humans can benefit the land as a normal, default way of life even as we take what we need to survive. They show what it's like to live in a reciprocal, mutually beneficial relationship with the land, and how hard it is to live this way when people are restricted to land they personally own or must have human permission to harvest.

### Choosing Good Neighbors

As I grew up, my family and many of my neighbors either owned our homes or had long-term leases. Because moving was difficult and expensive, people seemed to feel basically stuck with each other, whether they got along or not. Sometimes neighbors had serious disputes and ill feelings toward each other, and I remember feeling stressed living near people who didn't get along.

This sort of problem -- along with so many others -- is much less common when there is no land ownership, as people can separate more easily when they don't get along or simply want to live differently. Sioux man Ohiyesa described one method the Nez Perce used to maintain unity: "The Nez Perce tribe of Indians, like other tribes too large to be united under one chief, was composed of several bands, each distinct in sovereignty."[xxx-indian heroes and great chieftains|chief joseph] Whenever a group got too big for everyone to get along well, they split into groups such that each one had unity.

Pretty Shield described how her community had a quarrel in about 1832 and divided into two groups, the Mountain Crows and River Crows. Pretty Shield was born a Mountain Crow but went to live with an aunt who was a River Crow. She said, "This separation from my mother and my sisters was in fact not a very real one, because all the Crows came together often. These meetings gave me opportunities to see my family, so that I was happy..."[xxx-red mother|p21] I believe the Crows' quarrel did not escalate in part because they could separate easily and come together when they wished, an option that is not easy in cultures with land ownership.

Even people who get along well may want to travel or live apart. Ohiyesa described how Sioux bands would unite in summertime for their Sun Dance, writing, "It was midsummer and the red folk were happy. They lacked for nothing... One large circle of buffalo-skin teepees formed the movable village." The group then split into three bands, with one going west, one going south, and the third remaining in place.[xxx-indian child life|faithfulness long ears] They could choose to move, choose where to live, and choose neighbors easily because nobody owned land.

Avoiding land ownership also makes it easier to choose neighbors who can be trusted to help in an emergency. One of the earliest memories of Wikis, a boy of a healthy culture in the US Great Plains, was an enemy attack upon his village. A sentinel let out a war cry, and instantly the women gathered the children while the men shouted to each other and went off towards the sentinel to confront the threat. Each person had a clear role in helping the community respond, and each person acted immediately when the alarm went out to protect the village. The coordination and trust required for this kind of collective response is difficult to have in unhealthy cultures when each individual lives on their own plot of land and may not trust their neighbors.[xxx-when buffalo ran|attack on the camp]

This sort of solidarity and collective self-defense becomes much easier when people can easily move to live with people they trust, something that is much easier without artificially imposed land ownership.

Even farmers can live without land ownership. The Huron sustained themselves in part from agriculture, and they moved their villages every 10-20 years. Aware that overfarming could degrade the soil, they were careful to move to another area every few years while the soil was still healthy enough to regenerate. This stands in stark contrast to the US dust bowl that formed in the midwest in the 1930s, where many farmers totally exhausted the soil and left it barren, forcing many farmers to leave their land behind in search of paying work that could sustain them.[xxx-huron farmers of the north|p27]
