### Original - part of Heart-opening vs heart-closing

In the early 1600s, French Christian missionaries traveled to North America and stayed with a culture called the Huron. They were very puzzled by what they found.

The missionaries clearly saw that the Huron had leaders, and the people followed rules, and yet there were no police, no prisons, and no capital punishment, all of which they considered essential to French society. How could thousands of people possibly get along with each other without the threat of punishment?[xxx-huron farmers of the north|p71]

The Huron leaders seemed strange too. They didn't selfishly enrich themselves at the expense of their neighbors as did every European monarch. And they did not remain leaders until their death. In fact, they only remained leaders as long as people valued their leadership.

Even more shocking to the French missionaries, who had come to "save" these uncivilized people, was the Huron's unwillingness to beat their children. Unlike the prevailing European view of children as neutral beings who needed to be pressured and restrained to grow up well, the Huron recognized that children had rights and needs like people of any age, and they refused to resort to corporal punishment to control their behavior.[xxx-huron farmers of the north|p84]

What could account for such deep differences between these two kinds of culture?

### Are People Basically Social or Basically Selfish?

I believe the French missionaries had a fundamental misunderstanding about humans, which is common in authoritarian cultures. It comes down to a simple question: Are people basically social, or are they basically selfish?

If people are basically social, and we are _caring people who want to contribute to a meaningful culture_, then a person behaving inappropriately is _a good person making a mistake_. Such a person needs guidance, and probably wants guidance, to help them live well with others.

On the other hand, if people are basically selfish, and we're all just looking after ourselves and need the threat of punishment to force us to get along, then we need a punitive legal system with a strong threat of punishment. With this view, people behaving inappropriately are simply _bad people being themselves_.

The highest political leaders in every unhealthy authoritarian culture I have found propagate this belief in inherent human selfishness. In capitalist terms, we're inherently selfish. In religious terms, we're inherently bad, conditionally good, or separated from God. This belief in our inherent badness or selfishness justifies and legitimizes a punitive legal system that imposes law on supposedly inherently antisocial people.

Fortunately, the truth is that humans are fundamentally social. Just as each person has their sacred gifts -- their own life purpose, or special ways of giving to the world -- each person also has _universal sacred urges_. These are urges that every single person has for things like integrity, sharing, gratitude, self-defense, dignity, connection, solidarity, joy, authenticity, trust, meaning, aligning one's life with the deepest truth, and personal growth. Each person manifests these sacred urges in unique ways, but the sacred urges are universal in all people.

I realized that every person has these universal sacred urges when I noticed that people in healthy cultures exhibit them as a normal way of life. Someone might occasionally behave inappropriately, but this becomes an opportunity for mentoring, holding them accountable, or another response to return to a way of life where everyone embraces these qualities. That means these urges also exist in people in unhealthy cultures -- but in unhealthy cultures, many people are trained not to act on them.

There is something special about these sacred urges: they are deeper than feelings, in the sense that humans expect each other to act on these urges even when it doesn't feel good. If I accidentally break a friend's tool without having asked to borrow it, it might not feel good to own up, but having integrity and taking accountability for my mistake is the right thing to do. The deeper satisfaction of following sacred urges outweighs any transient discomfort of embarrassment or shame. In fact, following sacred urges often displaces shame, particularly the shame of not doing what we know in our heart is right.

Likewise, if people only stood in solidarity when it felt good, solidarity would not be worth much! It's our willingness to stand in solidarity or act with integrity even when it feels difficult that gives relationships strength. It's also what allows people to deeply trust each other.

These universal sacred urges are who we are as humans. They're part of how we manifest divinity into the world, each in our own way. But if these sacred urges really are part of who we all are as humans, how come deep integrity, connection, joy, and other of these universal sacred urges seem so uncommon?

### Open Heart vs Closed Heart

Divinity speaks to us and moves us through our heart. A person with a wide open heart manifests divinity into the world as they give their sacred gifts (ie live their life purpose), honor their sacred urges towards values like integrity and joy, and express their feelings. Since divinity and love are the same, a person with a wide open heart is giving their deepest love.

A person with a closed heart is somehow holding back. The closed heart blocks that divine wisdom so it doesn't manifest into the world, and instead the person acts selfishly. Different people may close their hearts in different ways in different circumstances.

How can we know that all of us, even the most selfish and cruel, have divinity speaking to us through our heart? The more wealth a person has, the more they have to close their heart to maintain their wealth even while their neighbors suffer in poverty. At the wealthiest levels, kings and billionaires are often said to have "hearts of stone" or be "cold-hearted," as their hearts are so completely closed.

People with open hearts recognize everybody as basically good, although some people are making mistakes. Don Cox's mother illustrated this open heart. Cox said, "Mama was a saint. She taught me that there were no bad people in the world, only those who made mistakes or stumbled along the path of righteousness. That na√Øve simplicity touched me to the marrow..."[xxx-just another nigger|joe cox's grandson]

I don't know any one definition of an open heart. But I notice open-hearted people generally seem to have these beliefs or attitudes:

<table>
<tr><th><u><b>Open-hearted</b></u></th><th><u><b>Closed-hearted</b></u></th></tr>
<tr><td>Life is basically good</td><td>Life is basically bad</td></tr>
<tr><td>People are basically good, and people behaving inappropriately are making mistakes</td><td>People are basically bad or selfish or conditionally good, and people misbehaving are being themselves</td></tr>
<tr><td>The world is alive; everything is divine</td><td>The world is dead; nothing is divine</td></tr>
<tr><td>I am a divine being, part of divine creation</td><td>I am separated from God / there is no God</td></tr>
<tr><td>The world welcomes my deepest love</td><td>I must hold back my love to protect myself; my deepest love is not welcome</td></tr>
<tr><td>People can take care of each other and stand for a culture of mutual respect</td><td>People need authorities to keep society safe and functioning smoothly</td></tr>
<tr><td>Everybody matters</td><td>Nobody matters or only I matter</td></tr>
<tr><td>Everything matters</td><td>Nothing matters</td></tr>
<tr><td>I can find trustworthy people who accept me for who I am</td><td>People are not trustworthy; it's not safe to be myself</td></tr>
<tr><td>Life is an adventure</td><td>Life is a drag</td></tr>
<tr><td>I am worthy of respect</td><td>I deserve my lot in life</td></tr>
</table>

### Does "Having an Open Heart" mean "Believing That Everyone is Kind?"

Obviously in unhealthy cultures many people act with extreme cruelty to each other, sometimes even to their own neighbors and family members. Having an open heart and recognizing divinity in oneself and others does not mean being blind to this truth.

A great example of open-heartedness comes from Martin Luther King Jr, a black American. He had many reasons to feel angry towards white people. His and his family's lives had been threatened many times. Their house had been firebombed. Two days before he was assassinated, his flight to Memphis was delayed due to a bomb threat. Yet, one day before he was assassinated by white people, what did he call them?

King acknowledged white people's threat on his life this way: "And then I got to Memphis. And some began to say the threats, or talk about the threats that were out. What would happen to me from some of our sick white brothers? Well, I don't know what will happen now... I just want to do God's will..."[xxx-mlk final speech afscmd]

I believe King had a wide open heart: he recognized his own and others' divinity, while recognizing that some others were really sick. He stood in solidarity with people who wanted to walk a good path, and he invited everyone to walk that good path with him, including white people. King even stood with the Vietnamese who suffered so much in the US-Vietnam war.

So, having an open heart does not mean thinking everyone is kind. An open heart simply allows my consciousness to be aware of mine and others' divinity, and allows me to fully and courageously manifest my divine gifts in service of what I care about most. This chapter explores a deep question: when a person acts hurtfully towards their neighbors, are they a good person making a mistake or a bad person being themselves? King calls certain white brothers "sick," which to me means he recognized that they were good people with a sickness, not bad people being themselves.

Recognizing that some people are sick does not necessarily mean tolerating that sickness. I believe Harriet Tubman kept an open heart even when her prayers about her master changed over from wishing that the Lord would "change dat man's heart, and make him a Christian" to saying "Lord, if you ain't never going to change dat man's heart, kill him, Lord, and take him out of de way, so he won't do no more mischief."[xxx-harriet moses of her people]

Tubman escaped the plantation and never killed the master, so far as I know. But her prayer for her master's death does not mean she closed her heart. It seems analogous to the Cherokee response when someone committed too-gruesome of a crime: if a person is set on behaving hurtfully, then exiling or killing them may be the only way to preserve the culture's baseline of respect. This does not mean closing one's heart to their divinity. _The inappropriate behavior itself is the bad thing, not the person_.

Keeping an open heart simply allows a person to act in service of what they most deeply care about. They feel the love in their heart so strongly that to act in any other way would feel too painful to even consider.

I remember attending a seminar on institutional racism towards black people and Latin American immigrants in the United States. It discussed how brutal the immigration and prison systems can be, the history of the Civil Rights movement, and the history and suppression of the Black Panthers, an American revolutionary movement from the 1960s-1980s focused on the liberation of black people. At the end, the host invited the attendees to share one lesson they learned from the seminar, and one concrete action they would carry out after leaving.

We were all arrayed in a big semicircle, and the vast majority of us were white people, mostly in our 20s, 30s, and 40s. Over and over I heard white people say things like, "I'm going to go home and write a post on the internet" or "I am going to go home and journal about this." Finally it was the turn of a Latina woman in the corner. When she spoke, fire leapt from her eyes and there was a steely resolve in her voice that was utterly lacking in anybody else's: "I will never let those immigration agents take my daughter. I will do whatever it takes."

That woman had spoken a few times about her daughter that day. In every word she spoke, her priority came through loud and clear: protecting her daughter.

Like King and the "sick white brothers," I am sure this woman would have preferred the immigration agents to open their hearts and stop acting with such cruelty. But since the agents kept their heart closed, this woman decided she would do whatever it takes in service of what she most cared about: her daughter. I believe she had an open heart and acted in service of the person she loved most in very difficult circumstances.

### Living Life as a Gift in Each Moment

I grew up believing that spiritual leaders walked spiritual paths, and everyone else walked "normal" paths. I didn't understand that we're all spiritual beings walking a spiritual path, with some of us holding back much more than others. This is obviously true because each of us is a divine being surrounded by other divine beings in the form of people, trees, squirrels, streams, and everything else, and every action or inaction has a rippling effect on all the beings around us. Every action can build others up and enrich their lives, or diminish things.

Reading stories from healthy cultures helped me recognize what it would be like to live each moment as a divine offering. In other words, I found stories of whole nations of people living each day with a wide open heart.

Mart√≠n Prechtel described how Tzutujil Mayans would court each other so well that they fed the Gods with beauty:

> The Tzutujil people approach living in general with a sense of courtly behavior. This meant knowing how to approach a spirit of another's soul without scaring it away, and still present one's true natural self unaltered. There were boys and novice shamans who were very good at touching the hearts of ladies and of spirits. They had inborn abilities and a fierce affection for what they were courting. Still others were successful because they loved the age-old courting process itself on whose back the whole ceremonial Tzutujil culture survived. The panache, fine stories, beguiling songs, offerings, and love-drunk attention to what they loved, either woman or spirit, were all part of this. The people knew that young men and women and shamans were feeding the Gods with beauty when, through their excellent speeches, heroic gifts, and serenades, admiration was created for what each loved.[xxx-secrets of the talking jaguar|p206]

In 1980, Peter Nabokov went to watch Pueblo people celebrate the 300-year anniversary of a successful revolution against Spanish rule, after which they were able to return to living without rulers. Long distance running was essential to their earlier coordinated uprising and a big part of their 300-year celebration. He interviewed a Pueblo runner named Talawema who had run American marathons, such as the Boston marathon, achieving very competitive times.

Talawema said, "Running was something the elders used to preach to us. Anytime you go somewhere on foot, you should try to run. It is a big part of our life. Even when you are old, as long as you can race or trot, at whatever pace, it makes you feel younger."[xxx-indian running|p100]

When Nabokov asked him to compare American marathons and Pueblo running, his answer illustrated what it's like to run-as-a-gift to bring people together: "There's no comparison. There you're running for yourself. Here it's all tribal. We're running for the people. The other Pueblos are feeling the same thing. It is a matter of getting there and what we're carrying in terms of the message of peace and harmony and uniting as a people. Not to the extent that there might be another revolt, that's pretty much out of the question, but to find each other again. Time is not important to us, it's how we do it."[xxx-indian running|p101]

Before training to be a shaman with the Tzutujil Maya in present-day Guatemala, Mart√≠n Prechtel grew up in the American southwest. He said, "As young children on the reservation I remember the deep need to run. For all the young Indian people, both girls and boys, running was as great a characteristic of the Indigenous life of Pueblo, Navajo, and Apache people still living in their original beloved homelands of the arid highlands of New Mexico as was their sense of comic joy or the generous ceremonial house-to-house feasting throughout their villages, for which they are still famous..."[xxx-unlikely peace cuchumaquic|always a place at the table]

These children related to school as an "imposed irrelevancy," as they learned at home everything they needed to live well with the Earth. Thus their American teachers characterized them as "arrogant, troublesome, and incapable of learning," when the truth was that school failed to teach them what they wanted to know. The school's running coaches embraced a common domineering attitude, where someone needed to win and someone needed to lose. They struggled with these kids though: while most of the boys over 13 years old had marathon times better than adult Olympians, they didn't feel like competing. They just wanted to run, preferably over wild land.

The kids loved to run hard, but not to race. They also didn't like to run alone. They liked running as a group. If a runner passed a relative or friend, they would run with them, no matter how much they had to slow down. The coaches had world-class Olympic-level athletes among these students, and their frustration was intense as the kids simply didn't care about their run times. If one person in a running group was slow, the others would wait or run in circles so they could catch up. They would run hard, but togetherness was important too.

Prechtel described the attitude: "Living and running were holy things you were supposed to get good at, not things to use to conquer, win, and get attention for. Running was not meant for taking but for giving gifts to the Holy in Nature. Running was an offering, a feeding of life."

Occasionally white people were invited to Pueblo foot races which were run by young men. There was no finish line, and runners would stop running when they felt like it. Visitors would ask, "How do they know who wins? How do they know when to stop running? Why do they run at all?"

Prechtel acknowledged how the sun and moon and other beings are kept strong by the boys who run. The sun each year runs its own race to help the animals thrive. When the sun tires, the world and all animals begin to flag and die, and the running boys keep the Sun strong and moving. Likewise the Moon runs and keeps the waters moving and the plants growing which everybody depends upon. There are no finish lines for the moon and sun; they must keep moving or the world dies.

Boys might compete to outdo each other in beauty, strength, and dedication, but without a finish line they simply ran until the gods had revived enough to run themselves.

Prechtel wrote, "everything in Nature ran according to its own nature; the running of grass was in its growing, the running of rivers their flowing, granite bubbled up, cooled, compressed and crumbled, birds lived, flew, sang and died, everything did what it needed to do, each simultaneously running its own race, each by living according to its own nature together, never leaving any other part of the universe behind. The world's Holy things raced constantly together, not to win anything over the next, but to keep the entire surging diverse motion of the living world from grinding to a halt, which is why there is no end to that race; no finish line. That would be oblivion to all."

When the boys eventually stopped running, they would return home and eat the food they knew their running had kept alive.

Growing up, I sometimes saw exercise as a chore or work, something to do and get out of the way so I could get back to a relaxed comfort. Even when I ran voluntarily, I often wore earphones so loud music would distract me from my tiredness, thoughts, and other life stresses.

These stories from the Pueblos, Apache, and Navajo helped me learn how to live life as a gift, even the supposedly-mundane or "normal" parts of life. When the young runners offered themselves as a gift, they brightened the world and they also strengthened themselves so they could show up in a good way should emergencies arise. I learned this when I studied the Bedonkohe Apache, led by Geronimo. Even after the Apaches acquired horses, the war parties often preferred to move on foot. Geronimo would lead warriors in guerilla strikes in Mexico, then split up his men and have them reconvene 3 days later. One of Geronimo's Apache warriors recalled that they traveled up to 75 miles and 14 hours per day, carrying three days' worth of food with them. When difficult situations required these warriors to face great challenges to feed or protect their people, they were ready.[xxx-indian running|p138]

When I first read of these running capabilities, they seemed too outlandish to be true. But once I learned that the runners had practiced giving their deepest love by serving divinity through their running since childhood, it made sense. Running becomes a relaxing joy in service of divinity, a gift of love, not a chore to grind through or avoid. Is it any wonder that the Apaches produced far more capable runners than their local hyper-competitive American high school running coaches?

### Original - from Sexual freedom vs sexual repression

I had to overcome a big misconception after I started hearing about matriarchies.

The words "matriarchy" and "patriarchy" sound similar. The suffix "-archy" means to rule, and I figured if men rule in patriarchal societies, women must rule in matriarchal societies. I assumed matriarchies are the same sort of culture, just with a different sex on top.

Fortunately, I was wrong!

In 2006, Cynthia Barnes visited the Mosuo who live inside China's borders. She described what she found as "not so much a kingdom of women as a kingdom of family." Instead of just men's needs or just women's needs being taken into account, everyone's needs were met.

There were no politicians or preachers encouraging "family values," no "broken homes," no social workers worried about single mothers, and no rape. There was no poverty, shame or stigma resulting from parents separating. Both men and women had sexual relationships as they felt the urge, and relationships waned when they ceased to be satisfying.

I don't believe there are "right" and "wrong" ways for people to have consenting relationships. However, healthy cultures have norms that encourage each person to find deep satisfaction throughout their lives and feel deep freedom in all their relationships. Different healthy cultures do this in different ways.

In unhealthy cultures many people go their entire lives without a deeply satisfying intimate relationship. Commonly imposed norms cause many people to feel stuck or trapped in their primary relationship rather than free.

What would it be like to live in a culture that continuously encourages everyone to have satisfying relationships? And how can healthy cultures be vastly more satisfying and secure for everybody, women, men and children?

### How Can Sexual Freedom Generate a Profoundly Free Society?

Healthy cultures around the world have a huge variety of beliefs and social structures that promote satisfying relationships. One such belief common in many healthy cultures of South America and around the world is _partible paternity_, the recognition that a child can have multiple fathers. In these cultures, including the Kulina, Bar√≠, Matis, Yequana, and others, women can be partially pregnant, and most sexually active women are.[xxx-sex at dawn|your daddies]

The underlying belief is that a fetus forms in a woman from the accumulation of semen. If a woman stopped having sex, people in these cultures believe her pregnancy would pause.

Like any mother, these women feel a responsibility to give their child every advantage they can. Thus women seek out joyful sex from an assortment of men, each of whose contributions she somehow values. She may value one lover for his leadership, another for his sense of humor, and another for his kindness. She may seek out sex with other men for their creativity, strength, wisdom, knowledge, good looks, or hunting prowess.

In such cultures, women honor their children by having sex with the most attractive men they can, in the recognition that the essence of each man will be imbued into her child. Of course, fulfilling this responsibility is commonly a pleasurable affair as well.

Indeed, the more men this aspiring mother has sex with, the more stable her child's life will be, as each man then embraces his role as one of several fathers. Children may have 2, 12, or any number of fathers at birth, each man feeling fully invested in the wellbeing of the young one, and none bearing the responsibilities of fatherhood alone.

Social norms like these have profound implications for men's, women's, and children's ability to live freely and find satisfaction in their lives.

_Children_: children in these cultures have many adults supporting them, mentoring them, and modeling for them as they grow up. If one parent dies, they have many others they can rely on. If one father dies, others are available to provide for the family so that the children are never solely dependent on a single father.

_Women_: Women who want strong men in their lives and the lives of their children do not depend on just a single man. The mother may decide to begin a sexual relationship with a man, and even if one of them breaks off the relationship, she will still be ok and her children will still be ok because she has a lot of other support from other fathers.

She is also more free to leave unsatisfying relationships. If a lover treats her poorly, or if she and a man disagree about some major life choice and want to go separate ways, she doesn't have to consider how hard it would be for herself and her children if she leaves the man. A particular man might be incredibly important to her, but she has so many other sources of support that she's not overly dependent on any one relationship lasting forever.

With so many people supporting each child, women are more free to invest energy outside mothering, including craft work, caring for the home, time out in the wilderness away from the village, cultivating their creative energies in art, music or dance, spending time with other adults and children, or whatever they choose.

And women are free to take on new lovers and leave old lovers as they wish. Women's sexual freedom isn't restricted as it is in legallly-enforced nuclear families. Having sex with a man who isn't a father doesn't jeopardize her relationships with the fathers, and breakups don't jeopardize her safety or her children's safety.

All this makes having a baby and rearing that child a much safer and more comfortable prospect for women.

_Men_: Men benefit tremendously from this narrative and social structure. As with women, men are free to let relationships ebb and flow, knowing their relationship with their children doesn't depend on staying in an intimate relationship with the mother. The man can continue to provide for the children and mother even as he finds new lovers, and perhaps takes on a second or third family to support. Men share the responsibilities of providing for the family and raising children with other men.

I believe men in these cultures also feel a profound freedom few men experience in unhealthy cultures: the freedom to risk their lives in service of the people they love, knowing that no one risks starvation or homelessness if the man dies.

What happens if a man is a woman's only husband and his children's only father? What if he's the only provider, with the woman tending the home while the man generates income?

As the only husband and father, even if he loves and is loved by a woman and their children, his life becomes too important to risk, which means he is not as free as he could be. In some unhealthy cultures a single mother whose husband dies can find a job and generate income, but since she is also taking care of children, this becomes very difficult at best. Many men find nuclear families a very difficult trap to navigate in part because being the only male adult makes the stakes higher for any risky decision.

In unhealthy cultures, a man may have an unsatisfying job and want to start a business that he knows could be risky. Alternatively, he may have some political view he wants to express freely but worries about speaking out and losing his job. Being the only male adult in the family makes the risks of potential failure or loss of income higher stakes than it needs to be.

One friend's story illustrates this masculine trap in unhealthy cultures. A friend, whom I'll call Seamus, was one of 11 siblings. In his 20s, Seamus became politically conscious, learning about all manner of political and corporate corruption and he began exploring nontraditional ways of life. He tried to speak with his father about these ideas and alternative life paths, but his father wasn't interested. He said that every ounce of energy had to be focused on keeping his factory job so he could provide for his wife and children.

Seamus believes his father didn't want to risk getting angry at his employer or hopeful for a different life because he just didn't believe he had energy for that. Instead of broadening his awareness and considering other possible life paths which might be more satisfying, he purposely closed himself off from other possibilities so that he could continue to provide for his family. After all, his wife and many children whom he loved depended on him -- and only him.

In cultures where children have many fathers, I believe this kind of problem is much less likely to occur than in unhealthy cultures.

And it turns out that encouraging people to have pleasurable sex more often has a lot of other benefits too.

### Sexual Sharing: When the Culture Encourages People to Have Sex With Someone Other Than Their Regular Partner

Human communities can develop very strong bonds indeed when people feel free to take on sexual partners besides their spouse.

The Inuit found that exchanging sexual partners helped strengthen long-distance bonds. Greenlandic-Danish explorer Knud Ramusen was pleasantly surprised to find one village chief gave up space in his bed for Ramusen with the understanding that Ramusen and the chief's wife would likely have sex. In the harsh arctic climate, villages may be very far apart. Bonds formed by sexual sharing helped to ensure that people would come to each others' aid even across great distances.[xxx-sex at dawn|making a mess of marriage]

Sex can strengthen bonds across entire communities, as the Kulina illustrate. In a ritual called _the order to get meat_, women travel in a group at dawn from house to house. At each stop, they sing to the men and "order" them to go hunting. One or more women step forward with a stick and bang on the house; they will have sex with the man that night if he is successful in his hunt. They have only one rule: in this ritual, women are not allowed to select their husband.

With a pretend reluctance, men go off to hunt, but not before holding a meeting together where they agree on a time and place to meet up before returning. Each man hunts alone, and before returning to the village, they all meet at their rendezvous. Here, the men who caught animals share with those who don't so that every man returns to the village with something.

When the men finally enter the village, the women form a large semicircle and sing erotic songs, provocatively asking the men to share their "meat." The men put their catch in a large pile in the center, sometimes with wry smiles and great drama. After dinner, each woman goes to bed with the man she selected. Everybody wins! As one researcher described, the "Kulina engage in this ritual with great humor and perform it regularly."[xxx-sex at dawn|paternity certainty]

Sex can also be healing and enlivening for observers. The Huron had a ceremony called Andacwander, most commonly requested by older men and women. When the ceremony served an old woman, all the unmarried young women in a village would meet in the old woman's house, and each young woman would decide with which young man she wished to have sex. Chiefs would notify the chosen young men who would arrive the following night. Couples occupied the entire house end-to-end and remained until dawn. The old woman and chiefs would sing and rattle tortoiseshells through the night. When Andacwander ceremonies were performed for an old man, a young woman would have sex with the older man. This was not a rare ceremony.[xxx-huron farmers of the north|p118]
