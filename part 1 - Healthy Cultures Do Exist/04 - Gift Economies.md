### Original

Often when activists describe their desire for a culture without rich and poor, and without anybody taking advantage of anybody else, I hear this dismissed as utopian, pie-in-the-sky, or an impossible and unreasonable ideal.

The Encyclopedia Britannica demonstrates this when it defines "utopia" as "an ideal commonwealth whose inhabitants exist under seemingly perfect conditions. Hence utopian and utopianism are words used to denote visionary reform that tends to be impossibly idealistic."[xxx-britannica utopia]

I have good news: the Encyclopedia Britannica is wrong. Utopias are real. Some exist now, and many more existed in the past. I believe living in a utopia is simply the experience of living in a healthy culture -- where everyone stands for a culture of mutual respect, and nobody rules over anybody else.

I'm not the only one to consider it a utopia to live in a healthy culture. Describing their way of life before Europeans arrived and imposed their laws, a collection of Mohawk writers noted, "It was, in fact, a kind of Utopia, a place where no one went hungry, a place where the people were happy and healthy."[xxx-a basic call to consciousness|p104]

Many people seem to think of utopias as places where people never suffer, but I think this is misleading. Terrible things like wars, famines, plagues, and other troubles can still occur. What makes a healthy culture a utopia is that people can trust their neighbors to take care of each other and act in service of the group in difficult moments rather than take advantage of each other. It's not that there are no big challenges; it's that nobody in the group needs to face the challenges alone.

One key aspect of living in a utopia is that group sharing is the norm, rather than individual profiting. These cultures have variations of a _gift economy_. Gift economies ensure everyone is taken care of, moving resources to where they're most needed or where they serve the greatest good. In contrast, unhealthy cultures operate with variations on a _profit economy_. Profit economies benefit individuals or sub-groups, moving resources to people who already have them. In profit economies, the more resources a person has, the more extra resources they're able to get. Thus profit economies reward selfishness, whereas gift economies reward generosity.

### Gift Economies Generate and Share Abundance

I experienced a gift economy among the Ashaninka where sharing was the norm. Plenty of other people living in other healthy cultures, past and present, show that this is not particularly unusual.

Nancy Basket summarized the traditional Cherokee culture of sharing this way: "If we all had a lot, then everybody had a lot. If there wasn't a whole lot, then no one had a whole lot."[xxx-basket interview]

Ohiyesa wrote, "During the summer, when Nature is at her best, and provides abundantly for the savage, it seems to me that no life is happier than his! Food is free -- lodging free -- everything free! All were alike rich in the summer, and, again, all were alike poor in the winter and early spring."[xxx-indian child life|early hardships]

For centuries, "savages" was an English term for all people of healthy cultures around the world. When he referred to savages, Ohiyesa was simply describing a common pattern in cultures that shared deeply as a normal way of life. (To learn why people of healthy cultures were called savages, see Chapter 22)

In some ways, this deep sharing is comparable to how many nuclear families live in unhealthy cultures, sharing food, heat, transportation, and shelter. The parents and children all become poorer or richer together as the family's income goes up or down. Parents don't typically hand the children a bill after every meal.

What is it like when an entire society embraces a gift economy where things are shared as needed, and what cultural practices help maintain such an economy so that people can continually generate and share abundance?

### Gift Economies and Indian Givers

One of my earliest childhood memories involves giving somebody a gift and noticing that they didn't use it. When I tried to take it back, I was called an "indian giver." I was told that to be a generous gift-giver, I was supposed to release all interest in what happens to my gift after I give it. I was told that the gift becomes someone else's property and therefore is no longer any of my business.

Not wanting the scorn I associated with being called an indian giver, that's how I learned to give gifts -- first it belonged to me, and now it belongs to someone else.  It took decades for me to learn that this attitude towards sharing is rooted in private property ownership and essential to maintaining authoritarian cultures. I was amazed to learn that my early childhood self had the healthier attitude to gift-giving!

All of life is simply divine beings giving their gifts. This is the recognition behind the first core spiritual practice of cultivating the practical, aware gratitude for the gifts of life. Chestnut trees give tasty chestnuts, stinging nettle plants heal joint pain, stars provide guidance, and the soil accepts us back and recycles us after we die. All these beings give divine gifts that make life possible and beautiful. No one makes them do this. Humans play their role by giving their own sacred gifts too -- the second core spiritual practice.

In gift economies, people simply figure out where gifts are most needed or valued, and everyone helps circulate gifts until they get to that highest use. This is where the derogatory phrase "indian giver" comes from: people of North American healthy cultures (known as indians) often gave gifts to European colonists, noticed they weren't being used, and thus asked for them back so the gifts could be given elsewhere. European colonists, who were used to private property ownership where giving a gift gave another person the right to do whatever they want with it, thus saw "indian giving" as a violation of their private property rights.[xxx-braiding sweetgrass|the gift of strawberries]

Nancy Basket described how the Cherokee would commonly ensure gifts got where they were needed, and how European colonists misunderstood this: "We would know each other well enough to see what they might need. And if we would give somebody a gift and they didn't use it, we would be embarrassed. And we would either take it back or something else because it wasn't being used. She didn't need it. And people called us Indian givers for that."[xxx-basket interview]

"Indian giver" became a negative label, describing someone who gave a gift and now selfishly wants it back. In reality, an "indian giver" is behaving thoughtfully, paying attention to whether the gift is needed. If the gift goes unused, the so-called indian giver exerts extra effort to retrieve the unused gift and pass it along to someone else who needs it more.

Due to this fundamental difference between caring for others and caring primarily for oneself, the contrast between these two economies is striking. Gift-economy practices can seem offensive to people in profit economies, and profit-economy practices can seem offensive to people in gift economies.

A person in a gift economy may feel upset if a person accepts a gift, doesn't use it, and then refuses to pass it on to someone else. A person from a profit economy may feel upset if they receive a gift only to find that the giver wants it back. Both sides may feel offended, and it reflects a fundamentally different perspective on sharing (focusing on others) and hoarding (focusing on oneself). Do gifts keep moving until they arrive where they are most needed? Or do people hoard possessions whether they need them or not?

Potawatomi woman Robin Kimmerer noted the consequences when she wrote, "If all the world is a commodity, how poor we grow. When all the world is a gift in motion, how wealthy we become."[xxx-braiding sweetgrass|the gift of strawberries]

This healthy-culture attitude to gift-giving stems from the deep recognition that all of life is simply the giving of divine gifts. Every spider, bear, bush, and cloud is giving its sacred gifts and somehow contributing to the web of life. Who would want to stop all that giving? Gift economies aim to circulate gifts rather than hoard them, and this kind of human economy fits in well with the larger nonhuman economy of all life.

Gift economies also have many practical benefits. They move resources from the haves to the have-nots, minimizing inequality. Gift economies ensure neighbors take care of each other. People might suffer poverty together occasionally, but nobody suffers poverty alone while others have abundance. Gift economies help people take care of each other whenever the group faces a big challenge.

### Private Property Rights vs Sacred Responsibilities

Robin Kimmerer described the gift-economy and profit-economy views of gifts. In an economy focused on private profit, people commonly think of a gift as free because they don't pay for it. But in a gift economy, _a gift is not free_. Instead, Kimmerer said, "The essence of the gift is that it creates a set of relationships. The currency of a gift economy is, at its root, reciprocity." Cultures that view private property as a collection of rights miss out on this essence of a gift as a collection of responsibilities.

If I am in a culture where hoarding is the norm, I could easily feel the need to hoard too. If I don't hoard when I have extra, how will I ensure I have enough during lean times? In profit-economies, many people carefully guard their possessions as well as the private property rights those possessions entail. In profit economies, individuals can easily fear poverty, and for many, the clearest way to avoid it is to acquire wealth through profitable work and hoard the savings. This is one way profit economies motivate selfish behavior.

Profit economies also motivate people to care about their private property rights. If someone else can influence how I use my possessions, how can I be sure I'll be able to use them when I'm in need?

This illustrates why, in profit economies, gifts and property ownership are associated with a set of rights, and many property owners jealously guard those rights. On the other hand, in gift economies, _gifts are associated with a set of responsibilities_.

One responsibility is to ensure the gift goes to the highest good. For example, a group can honor food by ensuring it goes to the hungriest person. A hungry person honors an apple much more than someone who throws it in the compost because their belly is already full.

Anyone who receives a gift also has a responsibility to the giver, and this stems from that third core spiritual practice, living in reciprocity. I get to give back to the people and nonhumans who give to me.

One aspect of this responsibility is to honor the gift, and one way to honor the gift is to make sure it goes to where it's most needed. Another way to honor the gift is to only take what is needed so that nothing is wasted. If I am collecting vines to make a basket, I make the basket only as big as I need, and I only collect the amount of vines required to make the basket.

Another aspect of responsibility is to serve the giver. If I take an apple from a tree, I am responsible for taking care of the apple tree. I might do this by watering or pruning it.  If I kill a deer, I am responsible for taking care of the deer's family. I might do this by protecting the deers' habitat, protecting deer from disrespectful poachers, or educating others about respectful hunting. If I take water from a stream, I'm responsible for helping take care of the stream. I could honor the stream by protecting it from pollution or erosion.

When I take the apple, deer meat, and stream water, I enter into a relationship with those beings. In spiritual terms, I get to take care of the beings who take care of me, otherwise someday they may stop giving their gifts. In ecological terms, I need to protect the beings whom I choose to depend upon, or else someday the food and water may no longer be there.

These spiritual attitudes underlying the gift economy are not about creating poverty by ignoring one's own needs. These attitudes generate abundance by training people to act in ways that allow everyone in the culture to meet their needs indefinitely, generation after generation.

When Europeans arrived on the North American east coast several centuries ago, they did not find forests full of tangled brush. They found forests they described as "open, park-like woods," which would have made it easy for deer to get around. Various North American groups had been using carefully controlled forest fires to tend the forest and grasslands for centuries.[xxx-1491|fire place]

One of the most common trees in eastern North America was the American Chestnut. The chestnut was once so abundant and its late-spring white flowers so thick in the forest canopy, people said it looked like the mountains were covered in snow in June.[xxx-sierra club snow chestnut] Many people of North American healthy cultures had tended the forest to encourage supportive habitats for animals and fruit and nut trees.[xxx-1491|rise and fall of the american bottom]

The same fruit and nut trees that fed humans also fed animals like deer, bear, and bison which humans could hunt. This deep spiritual practice of living in reciprocity with the Earth meant that humans generated abundance that spanned countless generations. Humans honored the nonhumans who gave so many gifts in part by protecting and enriching those nonhumans' habitats, which caused them to give even more gifts.

In ecological terms, when humans increased deer habitat, the deer population grew, increasing the number of deer that humans could hunt without overhunting. This was also true for the bear, bison, fish, and other beings humans depended upon. The human gift economy interacted with the larger non-human gift economy to generate tremendous abundance for all beings.

This shows how taking care of ourselves and taking care of the Earth are the same thing. When humans don't survive by working for bosses to make money, and instead serve the nonhumans they depend upon, they protect themselves from lean times by sharing abundance rather than hoarding.

The opposite of selfishness doesn't have to mean selflessly ignoring one's own needs. The opposite of selfishness can also mean ensuring that everybody's needs get met, humans and nonhumans alike. "Ensuring that everyone's needs get met" is also a good definition of solidarity.

When the Potawatomi, Cherokee, and other healthy culture people lived in their traditional gift economies, this was the practical and spiritual result: they generated incredible abundance. And this explains why they strongly encouraged sharing and heavily discouraged selfishness, even going so far as banishing or killing people who repeatedly insisted on behaving selfishly and showed no willingness to change, as explored in Chapter 4. Tolerating selfishness would have threatened the entire human and nonhuman gift economy. When allowed to fester, selfishness destroys abundance.

The different perspectives underlying gift economies and profit economies explain why so many European colonial traders were called selfish and greedy by the healthy-culture people they encountered. James Adair, a trader in southeast North America in the 1700s, noticed this and wrote, "they say we are covetous, because we do not give our poor relations such a share of our possessions as would keep them from want. There are but few of themselves we can blame on account of these crimes, for they are very kind and liberal to every one of their own tribe, even to the last morsel of food they enjoy."[xxx-illustrated native american|p236]

Even after my time with the Ashaninka, I still struggle to imagine living in a culture that protects everyone and generates such abundance. When sharing is the norm, everyone can routinely feel safe, as neighbors commonly support each other through difficult times. And this feeling of shared abundance and security motivates deep generosity.

On the flip side, many people in my unhealthy culture seem to have little interest in me unless they can profit. This creates an ongoing background experience of insecurity, no matter how much I have.

Kimmerer described this dichotomy. When she visits a store and sees food at low prices, she feels an urge to buy as much as she can. But when she imagined walking through a grocery store in which all the items were free, meaning she could leave with as much cheese and vegetables as she could carry, Kimmerer suddenly only felt like taking what she needed. When the food was being given, she said, "I felt self-restraint. I didn't want to take too much." In fact, this inspired an urge in her toward reciprocity: "I began thinking of what small presents I might bring to the vendors tomorrow."[xxx-braiding sweetgrass|the gift of strawberries]

When a gift economy forms and everybody trusts everybody else to share, magic happens. Okanagan Jeannette Armstrong described this magic when people make decisions taking both the land and human relationships into account. I believe she was also describing life in a gift economy when she said, "Something happens inside where the material things don't have a lot of meaning, where material wealth and the securing of it or being fearful and being frightened about not having 'things' to sustain you, disappears." She called it "_the most secure feeling in the world_."[xxx-original instructions|armstrong]

This deep security enables people to find a freedom that is chronically elusive in unhealthy cultures. Ohiyesa described how "Our great men not only divided their last kettle of food with a neighbor, but if great grief should come to them, such as the death of child or wife, they would voluntarily give away their few possessions and begin life over again in token of their sorrow." Unhealthy cultures that encourage fearful hoarding make it difficult to respond to a personal tragedy through deliberately giving up everything and rebuilding a new life of abundance.[xxx-from deep woods to civilization|civ preached practiced]

I believe that this freedom that comes from "the most secure feeling in the world" is the result of living in a gift economy rooted in the three core spiritual practices: cultivating a practical, aware gratitude for all the gifts I receive, giving my own gifts fully, and living in reciprocity.

This also clarifies how humans can be part of nature and why so many unhealthy-culture activities are called unnatural. For example, coal mines, clear-cut forests, and toxic chemicals are all generally considered unnatural. Human behavior is only unnatural when people act selfishly without taking the needs of the Earth into account. When fishers scour the ocean floor for every last fish, developers pave new roads, or cities pile up trash in landfills, these are only unnatural because the people aren't acting with the needs of the land in mind. Selfish behavior is unnatural.

Acting with generosity towards the Earth and building up abundance is what it means for humans to be part of nature. This explains why Western Shoshone man Corbin Harney said, "native people are not separate from the environment. We are the environment!"[xxx-original instructions|we are the environment]

What makes people of healthy cultures part of the environment? They are part of the environment because they take nonhumans' needs -- the needs of animals, plants, insects, water, soil, air, and more -- into account in everything they do. Caring for all life and caring for my life is the same because I am a part of all life.

This illustrates how anyone of any culture can choose to be part of their environment or part of nature: _take the nonhumans' needs into account in everything you do_.

### Stories of Sharing

Stories of deep sharing permeate the writings of European colonists as well as people of healthy cultures describing their way of life.

Jesuit Christian missionaries noted that the Huron would never let someone go without food or shelter. When someone's house burned down in the Huron village Ossossane, their neighbors came together to build them a new one. They did not have markets for trading or bartering, but instead embraced hospitality, gift-giving, and ceremonial exchanges. Visitors to a village were given food and shelter for as long as they wished to stay.[xxx-huron farmers of the north|p40]

The Huron would publicly announce whenever someone donated a large amount towards a feast, funeral, or ceremony, and this raised the donor's status. People thus enjoyed accumulating goods so that they could give away as much as possible, and thus earn their neighbors' gratitude. Feasts were common as people sought to build up their stash of food only to give it away.[xxx-huron farmers of the north|p93]

The Sioux commonly modeled deep giving for their children. They would host feasts to celebrate every accomplishment. Ohiyesa wrote, "[Crazy Horse] was carefully brought up according to the tribal customs. At that period the Sioux prided themselves on the training and development of their sons and daughters, and not a step in that development was overlooked as an excuse to bring the child before the public by giving a feast in its honor. At such times the parents often gave so generously to the needy that they almost impoverished themselves, thus setting an example to the child of self-denial for the general good. His first step alone, the first word spoken, first game killed, the attainment of manhood or womanhood, each was the occasion of a feast and dance in his honor, at which the poor always benefited to the full extent of the parents' ability."[xxx-indian heroes and great chieftains|crazy horse] When a couple was courting, their parents would celebrate this with feasts and gifts for those who had little.[xxx-indian heroes and great chieftains|two strike]

Ohiyesa described how parents intentionally raised children to give: "It was our belief that the love of possessions is a weakness to be overcome. Its appeal is to the material part, and if allowed its way it will in time disturb the spiritual balance of the man. Therefore the child must early learn the beauty of generosity. He is taught to give what he prizes most, and that he may taste the happiness of giving, he is made at an early age the family almoner. If a child is inclined to be grasping, or to cling to any of his little possessions, legends are related to him, telling of the contempt and disgrace falling upon the ungenerous and mean man."[xxx-soul of the indian|barbarism and the moral code]

Crazy Horse's mother demonstrated such mentoring. When Crazy Horse was four or five years old, the band faced a severe winter, and hunters struggled to get food. His diligent father finally killed two antelopes, and the little boy promptly got on his pony and rode around inviting all the old people to come get meat.

Neither his mother nor his father had authorized this! Soon a long line formed, and by the end the mother only had enough meat for two meals. The next day, hungry young Crazy Horse asked for food, and his mother told him the old people had taken it. She said, "Remember, my son, they went home singing praises in your name, not my name or your father's. You must be brave. You must live up to your reputation." Instead of punishing her son, Crazy Horse's mother invited him to remember he had done a good thing and bravely face the consequences even if he had to suffer a little for it.[xxx-indian heroes and great chieftains|crazy horse]

The Sioux intentionally trained their children to be brave, and one reason was that brave children would be willing to share instead of acting selfishly out of fear. This brave generosity was commonly publicly acknowledged and rewarded even in adulthood. For example, each year in June, Black Elk's village held a sun dance, and they would select a warrior who had recently shown special bravery. After playing a role in the ceremony, Black Elk described what came next: "he had to give gifts to those who had least of everything, and the braver he was, the more he gave away..." They raised the status of a specially brave warrior by giving him a special ceremonial role, and then allowed him to raise his status further by giving away many things to people in need. Abundance begets abundance.[xxx-black elk speaks|fight with three stars]

I believe that helping to redistribute resources is a core leadership role in healthy cultures. Martín Prechtel described how the Tzutujil Mayans had a "self-impoverished theocracy" where people "loved to get more than someone else, just so they could dress fancily and give it all away to be big." Prechtel wrote how the Tzutujil Mayans became leaders: "To get anywhere in traditional Mayan society, you had to work really hard to get wealth, get appointed to office without campaigning, and then give it all away." Each time a leader rose to a new level in their hierarchy, he or she gave away all their things so that they were equally as impoverished as everyone else.[xxx-secrets of the talking jaguar|p210]

Shamans also played this role. Whenever a shaman helped someone heal from an illness, they would give the shaman a great deal of food. The shaman would feed his family from these gifts and then give the rest away to whomever needed it most.[xxx-secrets of the talking jaguar|p248]

I witnessed a similar pattern while traveling in Peru. I was skeptical of every so-called shaman I encountered -- except one. This shaman of a local healthy culture accepted donations for holding ayahuasca ceremonies and letting visitors stay on his land. Based on the normal amount of donations, I noticed he must be living pretty well. Then I learned from an assistant that every few weeks, he took a cab into town and distributed the money to whomever needed it. When I discovered that he helped spread abundance rather than hoard it, I was willing to trust him in a way I hadn't trusted many self-anointed Peruvian shamans.

### Jesus Christ Wanted to Create a Healthy Culture that Generated Abundance for Everyone

Christians worship Jesus Christ as the sole Son of God, and one of his defining qualities was his willingness to give up all his possessions so he could walk a spiritual path without distraction. A rich man once came to him and asked for guidance. Jesus asked if he'd followed the basic rules, including avoiding murder, theft, and lying. The rich man said he had, and what else was there? Jesus told him to give up all his possessions. The rich man declined, and Jesus exclaimed to his disciples, "How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God!" Jesus' disciples felt astonished. Jesus said, "It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God."

His disciples could hardly believe this. Almost everyone in that culture was either rich or trying to get rich. They were so used to their culture that encouraged profiting and hoarding that they asked themselves, "Who then can be saved?" I believe Jesus' own disciples worried he was putting impossible demands on people which would keep almost everyone out of Heaven, when he was actually asking for a level of sharing that would be normal in a healthy culture![xxx-bible|esv mark 10:26]

Different religious and secular leaders have used different words and imagery to try to express the same core spiritual truths. I believe "living in a utopia," "living in a healthy culture," and "living in the kingdom of God" are all the same thing. All of these describe the profound satisfaction that comes from giving one's love fully in gratitude for all the gifts one receives from humans and nonhumans, while living in a culture based on sharing rather than profiting.

Creation and Creator are one, so receiving the gifts of life with deep gratitude is the same as receiving the gifts of God -- the first core spiritual practice.

The second core spiritual practice is to give one's love fully without reservation, participating in Creation by giving one's own sacred gifts. How many people learn to withhold their love out of fear of losing their comforts, privileges, and possessions? How many more people would willingly stand up to abusive authorities or speak out against foolish racism or sexism if they were not afraid of losing their comforts and safety?

Unhealthy cultures punish people in countless ways for behaving appropriately, and this is the result: many people learn to cling to their possessions and somehow withhold their love. Since a person's love is their own manifestation of divinity (since we're all divine beings), a person withholding their love is actually withholding their own divine nature and thus disconnected from divinity.

When Jesus Christ said that a person who trusted in riches would struggle to enter the Kingdom of God, I believe this is what he was talking about. Anyone who wishes to connect deeply with Creation and Creator must choose to give their love fully rather than selfishly cling to possessions and comforts. Fearfully clinging to one's possessions prevents a person from fully giving their love. Sadly, unhealthy cultures and their profit economies encourage people to selfishly protect their possessions rather than give their love freely.

Like so many deep lessons, this practice of giving up one's possessions has nuance. Jesus Christ kept the clothes he wore. Harriet Tubman kept her gun which protected her and the runaway slaves, as explored in Chapter 16. If Jesus Christ had gone without clothes or Tubman had gone without her gun, they could not have done as much good work. When I read Ohiyesa's words that "the love of possessions is a weakness," it teaches me to act in service of what most matters to me without letting fearful attachment to my possessions get in the way. It teaches me not to let the comforts and safety of my privilege get in the way of doing meaningful work in the world.

When American Black Panthers were discussing how to reach their political goals, Don Cox suggested the basic approach: "Use what you got to get what you need."[xxx-just another nigger|use what you got] When a person selfishly clings to their possessions and avoids acting in deep service, or a person only acts in service in ways that don't put their possessions at risk, the world becomes a darker place. When a person uses possessions to do important work in the world, with their focus clearly on achieving some greater good, the world becomes brighter.

Generous sharing is who we are as humans, but unhealthy cultures make this difficult. Instead of routinely experiencing the "most secure feeling in the world" which comes from living in a gift economy, the majority of people in unhealthy cultures focus on advancing themselves, or at least surviving, in a profit economy.

How do profit economies reward selfishness, directing and consuming people's lives? The next chapter, _Chapter 10: Profit Economies_, reveals what happens when rulers and their selfishness take hold.

#### Stories of Women Spreading Abundance (from chap 24)

I found many beautiful stories of women contributing to their healthy cultures by redistributing abundance. Jesuit missionaries stayed with the Montagnais-Naskapi and noticed that men left household affairs almost entirely up to the women. Regardless how much food he or she brought in, it never lasted long because she commonly shared the food with everyone. Paul Le Jeune wrote, "I have never seen my host ask a giddy young woman that he had with him what became of the provisions, although they were disappearing very fast."[xxx-commodity exchange and subordination]

Huron women likewise pooled their food in common storage so there would be enough for everyone.[xxx-huron farmers of the north|p28]

Nancy Basket described the traditional role of the Cherokee gigau (GIG-ah-oo), meaning beloved woman. A woman was chosen to be gigau because she was especially kind, fair and wise. Her job was to make sure all the collective food sources were stored well so there would be enough for everybody. Basket described the goal: "The Cherokee, if we all had a lot, then everybody had a lot. If there wasn't a whole lot, then no one had a whole lot." The gigau had another role too. If the council could not agree on whether to go to war, and they were split down the middle, the gigau would cast the deciding vote.[xxx-basket interview]

Basket described another way that women redistributed goods. In one ceremony, all the women would honor the oldest woman in town by bringing her gifts. They knew she didn't need all the stuff, but they trusted that she would know where the goods needed to go. This old woman would then distribute the gifts to whomever needed them the most.

When I lived briefly with the Ashaninka, women's willingness to share their wealth seemed magical to me. At every single house I visited, a woman graciously shared food and drink, and she invited me and my fellow travelers to rest. There was never any payment. I had to find other ways to give back.
