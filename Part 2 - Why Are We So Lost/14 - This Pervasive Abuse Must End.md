## Chapter 14: This Pervasive Abuse Must End

Sioux man Sitting Bull said, "The life of white men is slavery. They are prisoners in their towns or farms." How do you feel reading that? When I first read this, I thought he must be exaggerating.[xxx-griid sitting bull speech]

How can well-off, even middle- or upper-class people be prisoners?

Just as prisoners have no influence over how the prison rules are enforced, the vast majority of people in unhealthy nations have no influence over how the laws are created or enforced. And just as prisoners have little influence on what happens in the cell across the hall, the vast majority of citizens, when they behave obediently, have little influence over what happens around them. When huge numbers of people resign themselves to tolerating abusive behavior instead of seeking justice, then abuse becomes the norm.

Sadly, child sexual abuse runs rampant in these conditions, including by unaccountable religious, business and political authorities. For example, researchers in Germany, Ireland, the USA and Australia have found many thousands of child sexual abuse victims just from Catholic priests in each country. One investigation into Catholic abuses in France alone found over 216,000 child sexual assault victims between 1950-2020. Universally, higher Catholic Church authorities covered up or stalled investigations into the abusive priests.[xxx-aljazeera catholic pedophilia]

Child rape can become quite normalized. One boy was raped by monks in Buddhist Tibet and complained to other monks. He said, "they shrugged and said simply that that was just the way things were."[xxx-the struggle for modern tibet|chapter 3]

Many secular authority figures have also raped children, and few have faced any accountability at all -- clearly too few to deter any others. Famous British media personality Jimmy Savile sexually assaulted dozens of underaged people as young as 8 years old from the 1960s-1980s. When a young woman complained to British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) staff about his inappropriate behavior, the staff evicted her from the premises. Another was told, "keep your mouth shut, he's a VIP."[xxx-dame janet smith report|p3-4]<sup>,</sup>[xxx-dame janet smith report|p49]

An orphanage in Portugal was revealed to house a huge child sexual abuse operation in 2002, although the police and the Portuguese president were notified of the abuses by several boys and even a government minister in 1980. Several low-ranking men were prosecuted, but none of the wealthy international clients who flew in to spend time with the boys faced justice. Of course, the police and politicians who "failed" to investigate likewise went unpunished.[xxx-guardian portugal boys]<sup>,</sup>[xxx-guardian portugal president knew]

How do you think the Portuguese people felt watching these legal proceedings carefully ignore the worst perpetrators? They clearly did not prosecute the most powerful politicians, police, and businessmen who were involved -- how would you feel knowing all those people still had their wealth and power?

Tragically, such disturbing troubles are common in unhealthy nations that punish you for seeking justice. Thus similar stories can be found in the United States.

In the late 1980s in Omaha, Nebraska, a child sexual abuse operation was discovered based in the child foster care system. Investigators found child sexual abuse victims who described many satanic rituals and named many powerful people as abusers, including judges, politicians, and wealthy business executives. National figures were involved too, including billionaire George HW Bush, who at various times was a US president, vice president, and CIA director. Fifteen knowledgeable people died violent deaths during the investigation, and none of the perpetrators faced justice.[xxx-franklin cover up|p4-12]<sup>,</sup>[xxx-franklin cover up|pxvii]

Nothing occurred in any of these cases to suggest that the institutionalized child sexual abuse ever ended. People in all these unhealthy nations go on about their lives as if this rampant child abuse isn't still happening all around them.

How much child abuse is happening all around you right now, from authorities or other abusive adults? Do you know? If you found out, and if you decided to personally take action to stop the abuse, what would happen? That's right -- you would be punished, because only the police are allowed to actively enforce the law. You would be punished for seeking justice and upholding the laws you live by.

You would be punished if you intervened to stop child abuse, just like you'd be punished for trying to free unjustly imprisoned people or trying to stop a genocide.

Just like all of your neighbors, you would be punished for standing for what's right, and because so many people accept this way of life as legitimate, abusive behavior is widespread, with the worst predators having the most wealth and power.

A staggering level of abusive behavior always occurs when people allow themselves to be ruled and choose not to stand for what's right. All these disturbing troubles will continue until you and the people around you can generate a healthy nation, where everyone stands for a culture of mutual respect, and nobody rules over anybody else.

### Healthy Nations Don't Abuse Children

Can you imagine a world without child sexual abuse? Not just a world with more self-defense classes, or stronger laws, or better ways of supporting victims, but a world without _any_ child sexual abuse?

This world is possible. Healthy nations do not have child sexual abuse. When the Nootka first encountered Spanish conquistadors, they did not encounter any women. Instead, the Spanish "only brought men and young boys who got used as women whether they liked it or not."[xxx-daughters of copper woman|p71] Even in their first interaction with Europeans centuries ago, the Nootka noticed regular child rape that remains so common in unhealthy nations to this day. After a period of uneasy interactions, the Spaniards kidnapped, raped, and murdered two Nootka girls.[xxx-daughters of copper woman|p73-74]

The Nootkas' response shows that they had never experienced child sexual assault until encountering an unhealthy nation:

_"...The people had no way of understandin' what had happened. There'd never been anythin' like this in all the time since the beginning of life, and so they could only stare at the proof of horror and feel numb shock. They could see what had been done, but they couldn't understand how, or why. It had been hard enough to believe the Keestadores [conquistadors] would force a grown woman to have sex when they didn't want, but the thought of sex with a child was just too horrible for the people to even imagine, so they didn't know what to think._[xxx-daughters of copper woman|p73-74]

_The old woman examined both the babies, and it was as if the sure evidence of what she found shook the centrepost of all creation, and threatened the here and now as well as the past and future..."_[xxx-daughters of copper woman|p73-74]

The Nootka lived without child sexual assault until they encountered an unhealthy nation. This shows that it is possible for a whole nation to have _zero_ child sexual assault.

I knew child rape was vile, but why was it so bad that it would "[shake] the centrepost of all creation" and "[threaten] the here and now as well as the past and future?"[xxx-daughters of copper woman|p73-74]

Healthy nations see any disrespect as a cultural wound that affects everybody, and the Nootka recognized that this child rape was a severe disrespect and therefore a severe cultural wound. If this disrespect wasn't fully addressed, everything was at risk, and nothing would be safe.

The Nootka soon allied with neighboring groups and successfully killed all of these conquistadors. They saw how important it was to their nation's survival to protect themselves from predators.[xxx-daughters of copper woman|p79]

This shows the importance of maintaining that internal baseline of mutual respect. As the stories of widespread child abuse in unhealthy nations show, once a nation allows disrespect and tolerates predators, abusive behavior becomes normalized.

### What Is It Like to be Conquered? And What Does That Have to Do With You?

Living in an unhealthy nation means being trapped with predators. The vast majority of people accept this as normal and inevitable, even if tragic. Living with predators is "just the way life is."

But all of us have ancestors who once lived in healthy nations where everybody had dignity and stood for what's right as a normal way of life. This was the only way humans lived for millions of years. So what happened to cause so many people to tolerate abusive behavior? Why do so many people pretend things are fine when they're not, or blame poor people for problems caused by the rich, or accept living a meaningless life?

Imagine, again, if you were a king and wanted to conquer free people and train them for submissive obedience. You could torture and kill disobedient adults to scare the rest into submission, but the adults all grew up with a basically respectful childhood so they have dignity and high self-worth. The adults know what it's like to have deep integrity and trust and to stand for a culture of mutual respect, even if it's not allowed. Even if you imposed a shaming, disconnecting, pro-obedience religion, few would accept it.

But what if you could instill deep shame, low self-worth, and all manner of emotional dysfunction on people from a very young age so that they didn't have the spiritual strength to stand for what's right in adulthood? People who have been mistreated or deprived in childhood are likely to grow up and somehow mistreat their own children, knowingly or not. An endless cycle is maintained in which each generation trains the next to have strange emotional disturbances and feel hurtful qualities like shame, selfishness, disconnection, low awareness, or low self-worth.

Unfortunately, many ruling classes have recognized this truth, and this explains why forcibly kidnapping and abusing children has often been a key element in conquering previously-free people. It also explains why ongoing, widespread child abuse and deprivation are essential to maintaining support for abusive rulers in unhealthy nations across the centuries.

The Lakota and Nootka offer tragic examples, as they were ultimately unable to prevent conquering Christians from kidnapping most of their children and sending them to abusive boarding schools.

Lakota children experienced many years of abuse at the Carlisle Indian Industrial School in the United States, where physical and sexual abuse was common. Girls and boys were shamed and humiliated and trained to hate the healthy nation they'd grown up in. One man named White Hat said, "I was so angry that I was born an Indian that I didn't want to live."[xxx-black elk life of an american visionary|vanishing americans]

At boarding schools, children encountered a new form of child abuse: being forced to do work they often found meaningless or boring, unlike their traditional upbringing that emphasized always walking a meaningful, enlivening path. Ohiyesa hinted at his boredom when he wrote, "I hardly think I was ever tired in my life until those first days of boarding-school." Instead of being trained to provide for and protect his people, he was now continuously given meaningless schoolwork, "until not a semblance of our native dignity and self-respect was left."[xxx-from deep woods to civilization|on the white man's trail]

At Catholic boarding schools, Nootka girls learned to feel intense shame and believe that once a month they became filthy. The boys were taught that women were dirty and sinful, had no valuable opinions, and only existed to serve men. When the children were finally allowed home, the Nootka mothers "saw the fighting and the drunkenness where once there was love and respect. They saw men beating their wives and children. They saw mothers beating their children and even abandoning them. They saw girls who should have been clan mothers become prostitutes in the cities the invaders built."[xxx-daughters of copper woman|p62]

The Haudenosaunee[xxx-basic call to consciousness|p114], Potawatomi[xxx-braiding sweetgrass|putting down roots] and many other healthy nations suffered this way. Endless stories of child abuse in Catholic boarding schools from around the world tell a similar tale: child abuse and deprivation trains children to tolerate and perpetuate hurtful behavior, and this serves ruling classes as emotionally troubled, shame-filled people lack the spiritual strength to stand in solidarity to stop their abuse.

Some Lakota and Nootka were thankfully able to maintain much of their ancient wisdom through the terrible boarding school period and ongoing enforced poverty, and still stand in solidarity with the Earth today. But their experiences show that it only took a single generation for terrible troubles like drunkenness, shame, and domestic violence to take hold that seem so tragically widespread in every unhealthy nation. This proves again that humans didn't "evolve" to live in unhealthy nations; we have to be trained for it, and a key aspect of this training involves difficult childhoods that result in emotional and spiritual wounds that many people struggle with their whole lives.

While every instance of conquering is unique, they are all similarly traumatic. That means your ancestors went through something just as traumatic as the Nootka and Lakota. Your ancestors went through it decades, centuries, or maybe millennia ago, and if you don't remember those stories, it's only because those stories are no longer passed down. Thus drug and alcohol abuse, despair, depression, domestic violence, and the other widespread troubles may now seem normal or "just how life is."

But just because you are not aware of what your ancestors went through does not mean it did not happen. Those ancient traumas were never fully healed, and they still affect us today.

### Child Abuse Profoundly Affects Our Politics Today

Mistreatment of children has a profound effect on our politics, because people's childhood experiences can radically affect their spirituality -- that is, childhood experiences dramatically affect how people relate to themselves and the world. An abused or deprived child can struggle to trust other people or themselves, or cultivate deep rage, resentment, shame, sense of isolation, fear, stress, or other troubles that color the rest of their lives if they're unable to heal.

The _True Americanism_ study interviewed 40 men, 25 who volunteered to fight in the Vietnam war and 15 who took a stand to end that war, even at great personal risk. The large majority of war volunteers had grown up in traditional American families that researchers characterized as "conformistic," "emotionally isolated," and "autocratic," with adults emotionally lashing out at children while demanding respect in return, and even some physical abuse. The large majority of war-resisters grew up in households that researchers described as "warm," "gentle," and "friendly."[xxx-true americanism|p50]<sup>,</sup>[xxx-true americanism|p25]

The differences in adulthood were profound. The war volunteers were aware they obeyed corrupt political leaders and were just cogs in a machine, and they were ok with this, telling the researchers things like, "somebody has got to be the cog in the wheel..." and "many people have got their thumb in the pie over there..." and "it doesn't matter to me why we're fighting or where we're fighting. It's my job as a soldier..."[xxx-true americanism|p151]

In other words, these men clearly had learned to ignore their own dignity and sense of right and wrong. They were not offering their sacred gifts. Instead of living the most meaningful life imaginable, they were willing to be cogs in a machine they knew was corrupt.[xxx-true americanism|p151]

In contrast, the war-resisters had the spiritual strength to oppose an unjust war even at great personal risk, with almost all of them either having been imprisoned, awaiting sentencing or facing trial at the time of their interviews. Growing up in respectful settings, they cultivated the self-respect to stand for what's right in adulthood. But the differences in these two groups of men go deeper still.[xxx-true americanism|p3]

When children are repeatedly mistreated or deprived, they can learn to "hold back" or "shut down" parts of themselves, ignoring certain feelings, urges, and observations and developing hurtful attitudes in order to numb the pain of continual dissatisfaction. People can then learn to ignore that they're doing these things, making the protective behaviors and attitudes subconscious. When this is severe enough, it can lead to adults with very disturbing attitudes and behavior. Many adults struggle to feel any pleasure or connection at all, or even reject many kinds of affectionate physical pleasure.[xxx-violence.de prescott pleasure touch]<sup>,</sup>[xxx-body pleasure and the origins of violence]

Interviewers found that most war-volunteers were unable to feel deeply, describing relationships as a "burden." Investigating the war-volunteers' youth, researchers found that "the first act of sexual intercourse was emotionally and interpersonally insignificant to nearly all the boys." Only 5 out of 25 had any kind of emotional response. Of these five, two felt satisfied, one felt disappointed, and two of these five men felt disgust at their first sex. In adulthood, many war-volunteers sought sexual partners whom they described as "sluts, whores, easy lay," and researchers said, "superficiality and insincerity were the only stable emotional features of their response to women. There were almost no indications of guilt, embarrassment, reflection or self-criticism in their accounts of their activities."[xxx-true americanism|p137]

In contrast, the war-resisters valued sexual relationships based on good communication and emotional openness. Most men had not exhibited these qualities in early sexual encounters and felt regret, saying they had lost out on chances for personal growth. Many described having learned lessons from women sexual partners, including how to relate to people, share, and enjoy life.[xxx-true americanism|p141]<sup>,</sup>[xxx-true americanism|p147]

Abusive or deprived childhoods profoundly affect people's capacity for pleasure and connection, with some people unable to feel deeply in adulthood and even rejecting deep pleasure and connection as a "burden." In other words, these war-volunteers were _not able_ to feel certain feelings. They lacked a capacity that seems inherent or normal to people raised in a respectful way. They weren't necessarily taught to objectify women and embrace double standards. Child abuse can train children to have insecurity and little or no empathy. Of course someone who doesn't feel deeply is more likely to treat others like objects, i.e. objectifying them. And insecure people tend to put others down.

Even if ruling classes didn't manipulate elections, how are people supposed to agree on any political issues when some people value pleasure, connection and having a meaningful life, and others embrace superficiality and allow themselves to be cogs in a machine? 

When children are trained for obedience, and child abuse and deprivation can cause strong insecurities, is it any wonder that cowardice is common in adulthood, and people have low trust in each other?

Child abuse or deprivation aren't all-or-nothing. Some people grow up with far more than others, and nearly all of us raised in unhealthy nations carry at least some negative impacts from our childhood. Some kinds of child abuse become normalized, encouraged, and even legally required, such as forcing children to obey unaccountable authorities and tolerate meaningless or boring work in school so that they will obediently tolerate meaningless jobs in adulthood.

These emotional troubles can also make it difficult to have satisfying romantic and spousal relationships, limiting the connection and trust many people experience even in their families.

The war-resisters had grown up with a respectful childhood, so respect was the norm for them. They grew up with the spiritual strength needed to oppose an unjust war. The war-volunteers had grown up in disrespectful homes with troubles such as double standards, little loving touch, and emotional and physical abuse. In adulthood, they tolerated being a cog in a machine.

This is _not_ to say that "warriors are bad" or "war resistance is good." A nation must always be ready to defend itself. The question is whether or not people are emotionally capable of having integrity and deep relationships. Clearly when children are unable to heal from their abuse or deprivation, they can become adults willing to support disrespectful authorities.

Of course, not everyone trained for obedience becomes obedient. Some become people-pleasers, and others become self-centered. Every childhood is unique, and each child responds to their challenges in their own way. People can develop many hurtful attitudes from disrespectful childhoods when they're unable to heal.

Abused people commonly abuse their children, and even many parents who mean well still act disrespectfully in ways they do not see due to their own emotional troubles. When adults are not allowed to set good boundaries by standing for what's right, many people never learn to set healthy boundaries even in their personal lives, and thus struggle to set kind and firm boundaries with their children, which causes them to struggle. This is only compounded by the stresses many parents feel due to financial insecurity, relationship troubles, and other challenges. In this way, each generation trains the next to have emotional troubles that, over time, effectively train people to tolerate a disrespectful nation.

This shows how conquering is not a single event, but a continual process involving rampant child abuse. Child abuse is a core characteristic of every unhealthy nation that allows it to persist, generation after generation. That means _treating children respectfully is essential to creating healthy nations._

Unfortunately, deep training for submissive obedience does not end in childhood, but continues throughout adulthood. How are adults trained to tolerate abusive behavior all around them?

### When Adults Learn to "Hold Back" or "Shut Down" Parts of Themselves

Julian Assange said how people learn to tolerate abuse: "Every time we witness an injustice and do not act, we train our character to be passive in its presence and thereby eventually lose all ability to defend ourselves and those we love."[xxx-assange quote]

What qualities would people need to cultivate to have the strength to live in a healthy nation? And how are adults trained to tolerate living in an unhealthy nation with widespread exploitation?

* _Low-integrity:_ Every human has an urge to stand for what's right in solidarity with others, but this isn't allowed in unhealthy nations where people are expected to obey the law but not uphold it. When people learn to ignore injustice or feel helpless to stop it, life can seem meaningless, and low integrity becomes common.

* _Cowardice instead of bravery:_ When the police punish anyone who takes a stand against abusive authorities, they arrest the bravest people and scare the rest into holding back, tolerating abuse, and focusing on their own comfort and safety. When bravery is punished, cowardice becomes common.

* _Selfishness instead of generosity:_ Profit economies reward selfish, profit-seeking behavior rather than generosity.

* _Resentment instead of gratitude:_ When people live in financial desperation, learn to fear or resent their neighbors, learn to tolerate injustice, struggle with childhood emotional wounds, and do not know how to receive the gifts of the Earth, it is easy to feel resentment instead of gratitude for the gifts of life.

* _Disconnection instead of connection with people:_ When authorities propagate racist, sexist, or hateful attitudes, punish people for upholding their own law, and sabotage solidarity movements, it becomes difficult to have trusting and meaningful connections with many other people.

* _Disconnection instead of connection with nature:_ Profit economies force people to seek money to survive, rather than build a mutually enriching relationship with the Earth.

* _Displeasure instead of pleasure:_ Many people who are deprived of abundant loving touch in childhood may feel displeasure, dissatisfaction or disconnection as a normal, baseline experience of life and struggle to feel deep pleasure. And many religions discourage pleasure.

* _Forgetting instead of remembering:_ Everybody has ancestors who lived in healthy nations in the past, but most have forgotten and think their unhealthy nation is "just how life is."

* _Shame instead of dignity:_ Authoritarian religions train people to feel shame, disconnection from the divinity of life around and within us, belief in inherent badness or selfishness, displeasure, low self-worth, and other negative qualities.

* _Ignorance instead of awareness:_ Unhealthy nations often propagate hurtful racist or sexist assumptions, or rigid ideologies and dogmas about how life "should be," whether in economics, religion, or politics. Lazy or rigid thinking makes people easy to manipulate, so deep awareness is rare.

Many Christians are willing to believe that people are sinful and the world is sinful because qualities like dishonesty, selfishness, and cowardice are so widespread. The truth is that these hurtful qualities are only widespread in unhealthy nations because authorities create conditions that reward selfishness, discourage deep integrity and bravery, and punish those who stand for justice no matter what.

Childhood emotional wounds can cause a lifetime of significant unease, insecurity, or feeling of inherent badness which colors the way many people see the world. When such wounded children grow up around widespread selfishness, dishonesty, and cowardice, it's no wonder humans might seem inherently sinful.

However, no one is inherently bad, selfish or hateful. Hurtful qualities like selfishness or cowardice are not our nature as humans. They have to be trained.

### We Are Continually Reconquered

For millions of years, every child was trained for beautiful qualities, in part so they would have the strength to stand for a culture of mutual respect in solidarity with others. Only in recent times have people been trained otherwise.

And what is the result? _Abusive behavior is pervasive._

To maintain this way of life, we are continually reconquered: our bravest, wisest, and most generous spiritual leaders are attacked or killed. We are trapped in financial desperation and surrounded by deceit in the news media. Authoritarian religions train people to obey corrupt leaders. Leaders propagate racist, sexist, and hateful attitudes, and force poor people to fight their wars so the rich get even richer. Solidarity movements are continually sabotaged. Pollution and economic "development" poison and scar the living world that we're all part of. Selfishness is rewarded throughout the economy. And ongoing widespread childhood deprivation and abuse trains many people to support all this or resist ineffectively in countless different ways.

### It is Time to End this Pervasive Abuse

Ending this abuse will require creating new healthy nations, one community at a time, where _everyone agrees on the laws and everyone bravely upholds them, taking humans' and nonhumans' needs into account._

You and the people around you can do this. Explore paths to creating a new healthy nation in _Part 3 - The Deepest Revolution._
