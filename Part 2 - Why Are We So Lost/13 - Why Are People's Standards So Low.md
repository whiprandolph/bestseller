## Chapter 13: Why Are People's Standards So Low?

Authorities always encourage conquered people to accept their own submissive obedience as legitimate and normal. When people finally succumb to this mindset, they stop expecting much of themselves or others. People may not expect life to be deeply meaningful, don't trust others, or learn to focus mostly on themselves or pleasing others instead of standing for what's right. People may engage in superficial or wishful thinking, and even adopt the ideologies of their abusers.

The consequences are devastating. All manner of systemic problems take hold, as authorities enforce and encourage corruption, racism, sexism, hatred, and greed, as reviewed in Chapters 7 and 10, and many people sadly adopt some or all these hurtful attitudes or beliefs. These troubles exist in every unhealthy nation, and do not exist in any healthy nation I have found. But the troubles go deeper still.

_A person's integrity is their willingness to stand for a culture of mutual respect, including being honest, keeping promises, having an attitude of service, and standing for justice._ But when people are forbidden from standing for justice (because only the police may enforce the law, Chapter 6), and solidarity is continually sabotaged, making it hard to act in service (Chapter 8), deep integrity becomes rare. In fact, in unhealthy nations, low integrity, cowardice, low awareness and mutual understanding, superficiality, and low self-worth become common.

When people accept their unhealthy nation as "just the way life is," they also wind up accepting all these terrible troubles as tragic but inevitable. Troubles like discrimination, greed, corruption, cowardice, superficiality, low integrity start to seem normal. People can have low expectations or low standards for themselves and others, not expecting deep integrity or generosity from anybody.

There is good news, though. It's possible to live without troubles like discrimination and corruption, just like it's possible to live in a nation where everyone embraces integrity, bravery, and generosity, so that neighbors can deeply trust each other. Stories of healthy nations living in traditional times show how high our standards can be, and how low our standards currently are.

The path to creating new healthy nations will involve learning to hold ourselves and others to high standards of excellent and beautiful behavior, so that integrity, generosity, and other attractive qualities become common. This chapter will show how high our standards could be, how low our current standards are, and suggest ways to begin raising our standards.

### Healthy Nations Show How High our Standards Can Be

_Integrity:_ In every legal system around the world, people are required to testify under oath, and they are threatened with severe punishment for lying. The assumption is that participants might lie if they weren't scared.

In contrast, integrity was so pervasive among the traditional Apache that they did not compel anyone to take an oath because, according to Geronimo, "it is not believed that they will give false testimony in a matter relating to their own people."[xxx-geronimo autobio|Unwritten Laws of the Apaches]

Can you imagine if there was no need for an oath to tell the truth, because people in your community already expected total honesty from each other as a normal way of life?

_Physical resilience:_ Crow woman Pretty Shield described how physically resilient her people were when they lived in a traditional way. She said, "Ahh, my people were tough in those days... [W]hen I was young, if in winter a person fell into icy water, he got out, took off his wet clothes, and rolled in the snow, rubbing his body with it, and got warm. Then, after squeezing out the water, he put on his clothes and forgot about getting wet... Now my people wear gloves, and too many clothes. We are soft as mud."[xxx-red mother|p84]

Can you imagine if you and your community were so physically resilient that even being soaking wet in winter was nothing to worry about, but just a little trouble to fix?

_Generosity:_ A Christian missionary once visited men of the Ojibway, Cheyenne, Cree and Sioux nations, and he described Jesus Christ's selfless generosity. Christ gave away all his possessions and urged others to do the same while dedicating his life to feeding, healing, and protecting his people. The missionary was told that, prior to colonization, Jesus Christ's level of selfless generosity was simply normal among them.[xxx-from deep woods to civilization|civ preached practiced]

Can you imagine living in a nation where someone like Jesus Christ was considered admirable but not unusual because such selfless generosity is simply normal and expected?

_Meaningful Education for Young People:_ One Nootka storyteller described how the women would often have their moon time at the same time each month, and they would go to a special house and enjoy a four-day party. They would sit on special soft moss and give their blood back to the Earth and play games and talk. Women would rub each others' back and make special tea if someone had cramps. This became a major opportunity for older women to mentor younger women. For example, young women learned the special Frog posture that could help relieve cramps and make childbirth easier.

Can you imagine if adults took young people's education seriously, offering them the most meaningful mentorship they could every day?

_Benefitting the Earth:_ Stories abound of people of healthy nations actually benefitting the Earth as a normal way of life rather than depleting it. Robin Kimmerer described how Black Ash trees actually became _more abundant_ in regions where it was respectfully harvested by Mohawk and Potawatomi basket makers, and this remains true today.[xxx-braiding sweetgrass|wisgaak gokpenagen] Apache man Stalking Wolf described how he respectfully harvested a sapling to make a powerful bow so that the overall forest also benefitted.[xxx-the vision|p81]

Can you imagine if your normal way of life benefitted the Earth around you, increasing the natural abundance that you depend on?

When people bring out the best in each other, have high expectations, or hold each other to high standards, whole nations really are capable of maintaining that baseline of mutual respect among the people, and between people and the Earth.

Remember, members of nations such as the Potawatomi, Crow, Apache, and Nootka are people like anyone else. They have attitudes, skills and awareness that anyone could cultivate -- including you and other caring people you make friends with.

<div class="rev-act-body">Think of a time when someone had faith in you, maybe even more faith than you had in yourself. Did someone help you find the self-respect to leave an abusive romantic relationship? Did a coach help you cultivate the discipline to train at your sport and be the best you could be? Did a teacher help you realize you could be great at whatever you put your mind to? If this mentor did their job properly, they did not shame or punish you, but helped you see your unmet potential and urged you to reach it -- to be your best self, and not settle for less. Think of an example like this where someone really brought out the best in you, holding you to a high standard.<br/><br/>Watch for an instance where someone lets themselves or others down.

<div class="rev-act-body">Oftentimes, when one person feels upset by another, they'll express themselves but not communicate very clearly or very respectfully. Whenever someone expresses anger or frustration with you, or offers you constructive feedback, actively look for the lesson to learn so that you can grow from the experience. Repeat the lesson back to them, to ensure both you and the other person agree on it. This ensures you heard them properly, and that you only learn lessons that you agree with. Try to make it easy rather than difficult for others to give you constructive feedback if they see you making a mistake.</div></div>

#### Seeing the Trap of Low Standards

Regardless the type of government, when people accept their own submissive obedience as normal, all kinds of unnecessary problems start happening. These problems can seem normal and inevitable, just part of the human experience. But the truth is that they're only problems in unhealthy nations where people are not allowed to hold each other to a high standard of behavior.

#### Low Standards for Children

Adults' treatment of children and young adults offers many striking examples of low standards and the problems that result. Many people assume that it's simply normal and inevitable that teenagers act rebellious towards adults or that teenage years have to be awkward and stressful. However, children are supposed to continually learn to take ever greater responsibility for themselves until in their teen years they become self-reliant, or even able to contribute to their family. When children are not raised from birth on to grow to this level of maturity, by their teenage years, they and their society face a dilemma: teenagers have a biological urge for independence, but most haven't been prepared for independence by this age. Instead, the vast majority suffer through endless boring classes which prepare them for meaningless jobs later in life.

Healthy nations show how incredibly capable and confident children and young adults can be, and how teenage awkwardness and rebelliousness are merely symptoms of living in unhealthy nations.

Martin Prechtel describes how, among the Tzutujil Maya, both boys and girls were sufficiently mature and skilled to contribute to the family by the age of 12, carrying at least their own weight or more.[xxx-secrets of the talking jaguar|p99-100]

Young Nootka boys and girls were trained to have very strong physical endurance and very high standards. As one Nootka woman storyteller said, "every day we had to get our bodies ready. So that when the time came to go from bein' a girl to bein' a woman, we'd be ready." Girls learned many skills including gathering fiber and weaving. When puberty arrived, the young lady would have a rite of passage where, after a big party with her family and friends, she dressed up in her finest clothes and was taken out into the ocean. Far from shore, she would strip down naked and dive into the ocean and the boat would leave her all alone. She would swim back to her family and friends who lit a fire on the beach for her return. As she approached, "they'd start to sing a victory song about how a girl went for a swim and a woman came home." When children were raised with meaningful mentorship every day, they were ready for adulthood when the time came and other adults recognized it. When teenagers are treated respectfully, there is nothing to rebel against![xxx-daughters of copper woman|p101-102]

When a Mosuo girl grows to womanhood and reaches puberty around 13 or 14, she receives her own bedroom with two doors. One door enters the inner family area and one opens onto the street. In her room, called a flower room, the young woman has complete autonomy. She can easily have lovers visit. There is never an expectation that sexual partners raise the children, as the woman's brothers and other neighbors help raise her children. Every man knows that his sister's children are his primary responsibility, and so both men and women can have many sexual partners without having to worry about who the father is. They created a way of life where men, women and children get their needs met without each partner restricting the other's sexual freedom.[xxx-sex at dawn|love lust lagu]

One visitor in 2006 described the profound confidence these young Mosuo women have, calling them "sassy and confident," not fearing shame or persecution for their sexuality. Regardless how long any individual sexual relationship lasts, these young women know they will always have a home, family and support for their children.

Jean Liedloff acted as a physician among the Yequana, and she noted, "All [their] behaviour contradicted the assumptions I held about how children behave." She encountered a four-year-old with a gaping wound who came to her all alone and kept his composure even through the pain, and a 9-year-old with an abdominal wound after his older brother accidentally shot him with an arrow. There was no animosity or needless worry, and they didn't need sympathy to help them feel ok. Even the mother of the 9-year-old showed no anxiety -- after all, everything that could be done to address the injury was being done, so what good would feeling stress accomplish? The boy recovered just fine.[xxx-continuum concept|growing up]

Liedloff ascribed these children's emotional resilience and self-confidence to a few factors, including having sufficient time in their mother's arms in early childhood, being raised with healthy boundaries, and being corrected without guilt or shame when they made a mistake.

She watched how, if a young child sullied the floor in the family's house, he would be told sternly to go outside and not to make a mess inside. Thus the adults set healthy boundaries, but "he is not told that he is bad or that he is always doing the wrong thing. He never feels he is bad, only, at most, that he is a loved child doing an undesirable act." Adults trusted that the children were good people who made a mistake, not bad people who needed to be shamed into obeying, and therefore shame, insecurity, and emotional fragility were absent among the Yequana, even among young children and teenagers.

Teenage rebelliousness can occur for many reasons. In some cases, young people don't learn to walk a meaningful path or have low self-worth, so they act in self-destructive ways. Some teenagers never learned to hold good boundaries or honor others' boundaries, so they act hurtfully or carelessly. But often teenagers simply still have some dignity and do not like to submit to meaningless schoolwork and unaccountable authority figures, and their rebelliousness is actually their dignity trying to assert itself.

Troubles at the national level are reflected in many families. Adults who aren't allowed to take deep responsibility for their community or nation -- because they're not allowed to choose their laws or uphold them -- often struggle to raise children to take full responsibility for themselves and others. Adults who are not allowed to hold others, and especially their leaders, to high standards of good behavior struggle to respectfully hold children to high standards. Parents who are used to submissive obedience may expect the same from their children, or they may reject rules entirely and not hold firm respectful boundaries, tolerating careless or disrespectful behavior. None of these attitudes teach children how to have good boundaries.**

So many childhood difficulties are unnecessary, and only seem normal or inevitable in unhealthy nations where unfree people learn to hold each other to low standards.**

<div class="rev-act"><div class="rev-act-header">Revolutionary Activity #21<br/>Practice holding firm boundaries without encouraging others to feel shameful or guilty**</div>
<div class="rev-act-body">Next time someone acts hurtfully towards you or someone you care about, practice acknowledging the problematic behavior, the impact it had, and what behavior you would rather see without putting the other person down or making any hurtful or dismissive comments towards them. Trust that they want to know if they made a mistake and will grow from the experience. Many people are not used to being treated this way, with both respect and healthy boundaries, so be ready to help them understand what you expect of them. If they truly are not willing to hold themselves to a high standard, you will see this clearly, and you can decide not to cooperate any more.</div></div>

#### Low Standards for Politics

Low standards are pervasive everywhere in unhealthy nations, especially in politics. 

Politicians may brag about being "tough on crime," but they never talk about _ending crime._ Ending crime would require people to create a healthy nation like the Mosuo, who have so little crime that their language does not have words for "murder" or "rape."[xxx-sex at dawn|love lust lagu]

Many citizens in democracies care deeply about their society but knowingly vote for evil candidates anyway, which is what it means to vote for "the lesser evil." How can people think they're free if they can only choose between more or less evil political leaders? At its root, "evil" just means "corrupt" or "selfish," describing someone who prioritizes their own needs at the expense of the group.

Even so-called liberation movements will be disappointing as long as people accept their submissive obedience as legitimate.

For example, black people and women were both treated abominably in the United States at the start of the 1900s, facing severe discrimination in the workplace, courtroom, and other areas of life. After more than a century of "women's liberation" and "black liberation" movements, what is the result? Women and black people can now become corrupt politicians, just like they can be selfish rich business owners, corrupt judges and police officers, and well-paid wage slaves.

Women and black people have essentially been offered the same deal that white men have had since the United States' founding: if you're willing to embrace selfishness and sacrifice your integrity, you too can have positions of wealth and influence in your corrupt society. Plenty of women and black people have taken this deal, just like plenty of white men have taken it for centuries. Of course, many female and black spiritual leaders had to be killed or corrupted to achieve this result.

And since the United States remains an unhealthy nation, and every unhealthy nation _always_ has racism and sexism, these ancient forms of discrimination persist today, as discussed in Chapter 10. As long as people accept their submissive obedience as normal, they will have low standards, even for liberation movements.

Instead of seeking real freedom, authorities in unhealthy nations trick people into thinking that "freedom" means being able to do whatever you want without financial restraint, and so the way to become free is to get rich. But this is the faux-freedom of kings who don't care about anyone.

Real freedom comes when everyone in a nation cares for and protects each other and stands for what's right as a normal way of life, so everyone enjoys justice and respect with their neighbors.

I certainly do _not_ suggest anyone quit their job. However, individuals getting better-paying jobs is not the path to freedom. 

Revolutionaries like the Black Panthers and Zapatistas often kept working their jobs to support themselves as they sought to free their people. Black Panther Don Cox put it well: "use what you got to get what you need."[xxx-just another nigger|use what you got] Making money and getting rich shouldn't be the end-goal. Just like the Tzutujil Mayans and Huron who liked to get rich so they could give it all away, make money so you can do the most good in service of the people and nonhumans you love.

#### Low Standards for Men

One of the biggest examples of low standards is clear in a single question I keep hearing: _where are all the good men?_ In feminist literature around the world, this is a common question going back to the dawn of unhealthy nations.[xxx-odoc|ch47]

For years, I didn't understand the question, "where are all the good men?" I didn't know what a good man was until I studied healthy nations where boys are consistently raised to be good men who stand for what's right and bravely protect their people from harm.

A core masculine gift is setting boundaries, especially protecting one's people from threats. In all nations, few things inspire men more than the need to protect their people from danger. And yet, in unhealthy nations, the rulers are the greatest threat to the people. The greatest threat is not from outside; it is within the nation itself, and neither men nor women are allowed to confront it.

Abusive nations raise boys not to honor their innate spiritual calling to protect their people from threats as a gift of love, without any compensation or orders. Instead, men commonly grow up learning to tolerate, ignore, or perpetuate abuse. People may join the police or military, but they just have to follow orders too.

When boys are raised to deny or twist this deep love-gift of boundary-setting and protection, unhealthy nations wind up with deeply spiritually confused men who ask questions like "When does life become meaningful?" or "Why am I even here?" Many men accept living a meaningless life which feels terrible, but men can learn to ignore this misery. And once a man accepts living a meaningless life, why not get rich, or have superficial hobbies or conversations, or just try to keep life comfortable and easy?

This explains the spiritual meaning behind Henry David Thoreau's comment that "The mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation."[xxx-walden|economy] It also explains the statement that "Every man dies. Not every man really lives."[xxx-braveheart every man] Living a life where you've learned to hold back your love, afraid to stand for what's right, is deeply unsatisfying.

Of course, women can set boundaries and protect their people too. And yet, when this protective boundary-setting is forbidden in unhealthy nations, many men become spiritually lost, struggling to know how to live in a deeply satisfying way.

People endlessly debate the meaning of "toxic masculinity," and this perspective gets to the heart of the trouble: unhealthy nations do not train boys to be good men, because good men stand for what's right and protect their people from any threat, and authorities forbid this, meaning _it is illegal to be a good man in an unhealthy nation._ Boys learn to cope with this deep trouble in a variety of ways. Some become selfish or become people pleasers, or avoid reflecting on their meaningless life with endless distractions.

Boys and men are often held to very low standards, and one classic example is the phrase "boys will be boys." In India[xxx-hrw everyone blames me], the United States[xxx-boys will be boys], and other unhealthy nations around the world, authorities often make excuses for men who sexually assault women with some variation of "boys will be boys," as if sexual assault were normal, expected masculine behavior rather than a sign of severe emotional and spiritual disturbances.

Healthy nations show how people can have a way of life where men consistently show deep integrity and bravery, holding each other to very high standards.

Lakota man Black Elk described how his people were short on both food and ammunition in the late 1800s while being constantly driven by the American military. The Americans once attacked during a blizzard, and he said, "We could not stop the soldiers coming up, because we had not much ammunition. The soldiers had everything. But our men used spears and guns for clubs when the soldiers got there, and they fought hand to hand a while, holding the soldiers back until the women could break camp and get away with the children and ponies."[xxx-black elk speaks|walking black road]

Pretty Shield described how her Crow village would move between sites with all their homes and gear packed on horses. They could be attacked at any time, so male Crow scouts would travel ahead, around and behind the main group to give warning if enemies approached. They called these Crow scouts "wolves," and she said, "we women visited while we traveled... The men were ever watching these wolves, and we women constantly watched the men."[xxx-red mother|p22] The women trusted the men to organize themselves into a protection force and pay attention to each other to collectively protect the village, all without pay or threat of punishment.

Women's trust of men in these healthy nations was proof of the men's deep integrity, and many stories show how trusting women inspired bravery in their men in times of crisis. One Cheyenne boy named Wikis was 5 or 6 years old when his village was suddenly attacked, and men instantly ran towards the threat while women gathered the children. Instead of just running away, Wikis said, "My mother rushed out and caught me by the hand... and then she stopped and in a shrill, sweet voice began to sing; and other women that were running about stopped too, and began to sing songs to encourage their husbands and brothers and sons to fight bravely; for enemies were attacking the camp..."[xxx-when buffalo ran|attack on the camp]

Many stories from the Lakota also describe women inspiring their men to be brave by singing in this way.[xxx-odoc|ch47]

Of course, women can make fearsome fighters as well, and integrity and bravery are qualities for everyone to embrace. These stories showed me that everybody in a nation can have deep integrity and bravery, as the women would not have sung for untrustworthy men.

All these stories and many others showed me how low our standards are for each other in unhealthy nations. Low standards are simply a normal consequence when people are trapped in unfree societies and accept their own submissive obedience as legitimate. The path to building new healthy nations and living in freedom will involve learning to hold ourselves and others to a high standard of excellent and beautiful behavior.

And in order to have those high standards, people must learn how to have personal growth without feeling guilt or shame.

#### To Have High Standards, Learn to Grow Without Shame or Guilt

Feelings like shame or guilt are some of the biggest obstacles to deep personal growth. They can also make a person resistant to receiving feedback from others, making it difficult for people to hold each other to high standards of behavior. People can resist feedback because they don't want to be unfairly shamed or made to feel guilty. Even if the feedback is respectful, people can have subconscious shame or guilt from their childhood that gets triggered, and they can become insecure and defensive.

Thus, to really hold yourself and others to a high standard and help people grow when they make a mistake, it is crucial to learn how to pursue personal and collective growth without shame or guilt.

The first requirement is to have the attitude that, when someone lets you down, they are a _good person making a mistake_, not a bad person being themselves. Trust that they want to show up in a good way and just don't know how -- there's something they're missing, but if they could see it, they would grow and show up well.

Some people are so stuck that they don't grow even with repeated respectful feedback, and you may need to set boundaries and not allow their hurtful behavior in your life or community anymore. But if someone acts hurtfully and you start with the attitude that they're "bad," they will be resistant to any feedback that you offer.

<div class="rev-act"><div class="rev-act-header">Revolutionary Activity #22<br/>Learn without guilt or shame</div>
<div class="rev-act-body">Think of a time you made a mistake and you felt guilty or shameful in response, perhaps because an adult said you should feel this way. How much harder did those feelings make it to learn from your mistake? How helpful would it have been if the person trusted that you wanted to learn, and just helped you grow from the experience? Next time you make a mistake, practice learning what you can while noticing any feelings of guilt or shame and just letting them go.</div></div>

#### Everything is a Skill That Can be Practiced Without Guilt or Shame

Think back to a skill you learned as a child. Imagine, for example, that you learned to play soccer, including smaller skills such as how to dribble or pass the ball. To get better at passing, what did you do?

You practiced: you tried your best to kick the soccer ball to someone, and sometimes the ball went where you intended and sometimes it didn't. When you kicked the ball in the wrong direction, you figured out what lesson to learn, hopefully without any shame, and then practiced passing the ball with those new lessons in mind. The more you practiced, the more lessons you learned, and the more proper technique became normal and engrained. If you approached all aspects of soccer this way, eventually you became a skilled soccer player.

Living with integrity, awareness, gratitude, and generosity are skills too, and you can practice each of these intentionally just like any other skill. Practice approaching life with these qualities, and notice when you show up with them and when you don't. Perhaps sometimes you don't have the awareness you want, or you are afraid to tell the truth and so you lie instead.

Cultivating these qualities is just like learning to kick a soccer ball. When you mess up, avoid any sense of guilt or shame. Just recognize that you made a mistake, learn from it, and do better next time. If you hurt or disappointed someone else, acknowledge your mistake, do your best to make it right, learn whatever lessons you can, and commit to doing better. And if you feel any residual guilt or shame, let it go. You are just practicing and learning.

And just like you practice kicking a soccer ball before the game, you can practice these beautiful qualities outside the normal flow of life. Take bravery for example, which is the ability to remain conscious and do what you know in your heart is right even if you feel uncomfortable or afraid. To practice bravery, you can intentionally put yourself in uncomfortable or scary situations and practice maintaining your composure. If you're scared of dancing, face your fear and go dancing. If cold water feels uncomfortable, practice keeping your composure in cold water. Learn to feel _comfortable in the midst of discomfort_ so that nothing causes you to ever "hold back" or "shut down" parts of yourself.

The book _One Disease One Cure_ contains many more suggestions for cultivating bravery, integrity, and other qualities.[xxx-odoc]

Spiritual growth can be joyful rather than stressful when you approach it without shame and guilt, as part of a group of friends that bring out the best in each other. So long as you're truly committed to that path of spiritual growth, mistakes are simply learning opportunities along the way.

Recognizing two complementary truths will accelerate your spiritual growth. First, _you are already perfect,_ even with all your faults. Second, _you have unmet potential,_ and you must strive to fulfill it to give your deepest love. If you feel self-doubt, low self-worth, or depression, pause trying to grow and focus on total self-acceptance. Deep self-acceptance is the foundation for deep spiritual growth. Accept that you are perfect as you are now, faults and all, and you're basically ok. With this self-acceptance, see your unmet potential, and grow to meet it.**

In my personal life, when I really embraced these attitudes, my rate of growth increased. I started learning life lessons faster than before because I wasn't wasting time feeling shame and guilt. I just noticed my mistakes, learned from them, and moved on.

Part 3 will share more detail about forming deep relationships, healthy communities and eventually healthy nations based on the stories of others who have done this. These shame-free and guilt-free attitudes to personal growth are foundational so that people can hold themselves and each other to high standards of behavior and grow from their mistakes.

High standards of behavior will allow you and other caring people to create a culture of deep trust, where qualities like integrity, bravery, awareness, and generosity are simply normal and expected.

<div class="rev-act-body">Think of a fear that you're avoiding right now. You may have lied to someone and you're afraid of owning up to it, or you're afraid of quitting an unsatisfying job or asking an attractive person on a date. Face your fear, recognize that you can handle whatever comes, and do the thing you're afraid to do.</div></div>
