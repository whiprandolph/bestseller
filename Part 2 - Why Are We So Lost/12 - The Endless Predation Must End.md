## Chapter 12: The Endless Predation Must End

Sioux man Sitting Bull said, "The life of white men is slavery. They are prisoners in their towns or farms." When I first read this, I thought he must be exaggerating.

How can well-off, even middle-class people be prisoners?

Just as prisoners have no influence over how the prison rules are enforced, the vast majority of people in unhealthy cultures have no influence over how the laws are created or enforced. And just as prisoners have little influence on what happens in the cell across the hall, the vast majority of citizens, when they behave obediently, have little influence over what happens around them. When huge numbers of people resign themselves to tolerating predatory behavior instead of standing up together for what's right, abuse and exploitation become the norm.

Sadly, child sexual abuse runs rampant in these conditions, including by unaccountable religious, business and political authorities. For example, researchers in Germany, Ireland, the USA and Australia have found many thousands of child sexual abuse victims just from Catholic priests in each country. One investigation into Catholic abuses in France alone found over 216,000 child sexual assault victims between 1950-2020. Universally, higher Catholic Church authorities covered up or stalled investigations into the abusive priests.

Child rape can become quite normalized. One boy was raped by monks in Buddhist Tibet and complained to other monks. He said, "they shrugged and said simply that that was just the way things were."

Many secular authority figures have also raped children, and few have faced any accountability at all -- clearly too few to deter any others. Famous British media personality Jimmy Savile raped dozens of underaged people as young as 8 years old from the 1960s-1980s, and British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) staff evicted young women from the premisis who complained of his inappropriate behavior.

An orphanage in Portugal was revealed to house a huge child sexual abuse operation in 2002, although the police and the Portuguese president were notified of the abuses by several boys and even a government minister in 1980. Several low-ranking men were prosecuted, but none of the wealthy international clients who flew in to spend time with the boys faced justice. Of course, the police and politicians who "failed" to investigate likewise went unpunished.

In the late 1980s in Omaha, Nebraska in the United States, a child sexual abuse operation was discovered based in the child foster care system. Investigators found child sexual abuse victims who named many powerful politicians as abusers, including regional judges, politicians, and business executives. Possibly the most powerful person named as an abuser was president George HW Bush, who also had been vice president and director of the CIA, making him one of the most powerful people in the world. Fifteen knowledgeable people died violent deaths during the investigation, and none of the many perpetrators faced justice.

Nothing occurred in any of these cases to suggest that the institutionalized child sexual abuse ever ended. People in all these unhealthy cultures go on about their lives as if this rampant child abuse isn't still happening all around them.

Other kinds of predation are common, with different kinds more or less common in different unhealthy cultures. 

Even soldiers are not safe from predatory behavior. Decades after scientists had established the harmful effects of nuclear radiation, the Soviet Union, United States, France, and Great Britain all knowingly exposed their soldiers to radiation without their consent. Reports from all these countries show that soldiers were expected to remain silent, even as they were left to face terrible injuries, and even as their children were born with deformities that were clearly traceable to radiation poisoning. Soldiers widely understood the risks as well. One French soldier said, "we knew these things," but authorities demanded that soldiers "obey and shut up."

A staggering level of abusive and exploitative behavior always occurs when people allow themselves to be ruled and choose not to stand for what's right. All these disturbing troubles will continue till people can generate healthy cultures again, where everyone stands for what's right, and nobody rules over anybody else.

### Healthy Cultures Don't Abuse Children

Can you imagine a world without child sexual abuse? Not just a world with more women's self-defense classes (which I support), or stronger laws, or better ways of supporting victims. Can you imagine a world without _any_ child sexual abuse?

This world is possible. Healthy cultures do not have child sexual abuse. When the Nootka first encountered Spanish conquistadors, they did not encounter any women. Instead, the Spanish "only brought men and young boys who got used as women whether they liked it or not." Even in their first interaction with Europeans centuries ago, the Nootka noticed regular child rape that remains so common in unhealthy cultures to this day. After a period of uneasy interactions, the Spaniards kidnapped, raped, and murdered two Nootka girls of about 10 years old.

The Nootkas' response showed me that they had never experienced child sexual assault until encountering an unhealthy culture:

_"...The people had no way of understandin' what had happened. There'd never been anythin' like this in all the time since the beginning of life, and so they could only stare at the proof of horror and feel numb shock. They could see what had been done, but they couldn't understand how, or why. It had been hard enough to believe the Keestadores [conquistadors] would force a grown woman to have sex when they didn't want, but the thought of sex with a child was just too horrible for the people to even imagine, so they didn't know what to think._

_The old woman examined both the babies, and it was as if the sure evidence of what she found shook the centrepost of all creation, and threatened the here and now as well as the past and future..."_

This story was transformative for me. The Nootka lived without child sexual assault until they encountered an unhealthy culture. This taught me that it is possible to have zero child sexual assault when people can maintain a healthy culture.

I knew child rape was bad, but why was it so bad that it would "[shake] the centrepost of all creation" and "[threaten] the here and now as well as the past and future?"

Healthy cultures see any disrespect as a cultural wound that affects everybody, and the Nootka recognized that this child rape was a severe disrespect and therefore a severe cultural wound. If this disrespect wasn't fully addressed, everything was at risk, and nothing would be safe.

The Nootka soon allied with neighboring groups and successfully killed all of these conquistadors. They saw how important it was to their culture's survival to protect themselves from predators.

This taught me the importance of maintaining that internal baseline of mutual respect. Once a culture allows disrespect and tolerates selfish predators, there is no end to the trouble.

### We Are Continually Being Reconquered

Living in an unhealthy culture means being trapped with predators. The vast majority of people accept this as normal and inevitable, even if tragic. Living with predators is "just the way life is."

But all of us have ancestors who once lived in healthy cultures where everybody had dignity and stood for what's right as a normal way of life. This was the only way humans lived for millions of years. So what happened to cause so many people to tolerate abuse and predatory behavior? Why do so many people pretend things are fine when they're not, or blame poor people for problems caused by the rich, or accept living a meaningless life?

Imagine, again, if you were a king and wanted to conquer free people and train them for submissive obedience. You could torture and kill disobedient adults to scare the rest into submission, but the adults all grew up with a basically respectful childhood so they carry a deep dignity and high self-worth. The adults know what it's like to have deep integrity and trust and to stand for what's right, even if it's not allowed. Even if you imposed a shaming, disconnecting, pro-obedience religion, few would accept it.

But what if you could instill deep shame, low self-worth, and all manner of emotional dysfunction on people from a very young age so that they didn't have the emotional strength to stand for what's right in adulthood? And people who have been mistreated or deprived in childhood are likely to grow up and somehow mistreat their own children, knowingly or not. An endless cycle would begin where each generation trains the next to have strange emotional disturbances and feel shame, selfishness, low awareness, low self-worth, or other hurtful qualities.

Unfortunately, many ruling classes have recognized this truth, and this explains why forcibly kidnapping and abusing children has often been a key element in conquering previously-free people. It also explains why ongoing, widespread child abuse and deprivation is essential to maintaining support for abusive rulers in unhealthy cultures across the centuries.

The Lakota and Nootka offer tragic examples, as they were ultimately unable to prevent conquering Christians from kidnapping most of their children and sending them to abusive boarding schools.

Lakota children experienced many years of abuse at the Carlisle Indian Industrial School in the United States, where physical and sexual abuse was common and girls and boys were shamed and humiliated in countless ways and trained to hate the healthy culture they'd grown up in. One man named White Hat noted, "I was so angry that I was born an Indian that I didn't want to live."

At Catholic boarding schools, Nootka girls likewise learned to feel intense shame and believe that once a month they became filthy. The boys were taught that women were filthy and sinful and had no valuable opinions and only existed to serve men. When the children were finally allowed home, the Nootka mothers "saw the fighting and the drunkenness where once there was love and respect. They saw men beating their wives and children. They saw mothers beating their children and even abandoning them. They saw girls who should have been clan mothers become prostitutes in the cities the invaders built."

Countless stories of child abuse in Catholic boarding schools from around the world tell a similar story: child abuse and deprivation trains children to tolerate and perpetuate hurtful behavior, and this serves ruling classes as emotionally troubled, shame-filled people are unable to stand in solidarity to stop their abuse.

Some Lakota and Nootka were thankfully able to maintain much of their ancient wisdom through the terrible boarding school period and ongoing enforced poverty, and still stand in solidarity with the Earth today. But their experiences show that it only took a single generation for drunkenness, shame, domestic violence, and other terrible troubles to take hold, proving again that humans didn't "evolve" to live in unhealthy cultures; we have to be trained for it, and a key aspect of this training involves difficult childhoods that result in emotional and spiritual wounds that many people struggle with their whole lives.

### Child Abuse Profoundly Affects Our Politics Today

Mistreatment of children has a profound effect on our politics, because people's childhood experiences can radically affect their spirituality -- that is, childhood experiences dramatically affect how people relate to themselves and the world. An abused or deprived child can struggle to trust other people or themselves, or cultivate deep rage, resentment, shame, sense of isolation, fear, stress, or other troubles that color the rest of their lives if they're unable to heal.

The _True Americanism_ study interviewed 50 men, 25 who volunteered to fight in the Vietnam war and 25 who took a stand to end that war, even at great personal risk. In the large majority of cases of war volunteers, the men had grown up in traditional American families that researchers characterized as "conformistic," "emotionally isolated," and "autocratic," with adults emotionally lashing out at children while demanding respect in return, and even some physical abuse. The large majority of war-resisters grew up in households that researchers described as "warm," "gentle," and "friendly."

The differences in adulthood were profound. The war volunteers were aware they obeyed corrupt political leaders and were just cogs in a machine, and they were ok with this, telling the researchers things like, "somebody has got to be the cog in the wheel..." and "it doesn't matter to me why we're fighting or where we're fighting. It's my job as a soldier..." In other words, these men clearly had learned to ignore their own dignity and sense of right and wrong. They were not offering their sacred gifts. Instead of walking the most meaningful life imaginable, they were willing to be cogs in a machine they knew was corrupt. 

In contrast, the war-resisters had the internal clarity and strength to oppose an unjust war even at great personal risk, with some going to prison for years. Growing up in respectful settings, they cultivated the self-respect to stand for what's right in adulthood. But the differences in these two groups of men go deeper still.

When children are repeatedly mistreated or deprived, they can learn to "hold back" or "shut down" parts of themselves, ignore parts of their experience, and develop hurtful attitudes in order to numb the pain of continual dissatisfaction. When this is severe enough, it can lead to adults with very disturbing attitudes and behavior. Many adults struggle to feel any pleasure or connection at all, or even find pleasure revolting.

Interviewers found that most war-volunteers were unable to feel deeply, describing any sort of deepening relationship as a "burden." Investigating the war-volunteers' youth, researchers found that "the first act of sexual intercourse was emotionally and interpersonally insignificant to nearly all the boys." Only 5 out of 25 had any kind of emotional response. Of these five, two felt satisfied, one felt disappointed, and two of these five men felt disgust at their first sex. In adulthood, many war-volunteers sought sexual partners whom they described as "sluts, whores, easy lay," and researchers said, "superficiality and insincerity were the only stable emotional features of their response to women. There were almost no indications of guilt, embarrassment, reflection or self-criticism in their accounts of their activities."

In contrast, the war-resisters valued sexual relationships based on sharing, sensitivity, and self-restraint. The men who did not exhibit these qualities in early sexual encounters expressed regret and believed that they had lost out on chances for personal growth. Many described having learned deep lessons from women sexual partners, including how to relate to people, share, and enjoy life.

Abusive or deprived childhoods profoundly affect people's capacity for pleasure and connection, with some people simply unable to feel deeply in adulthood and even rejecting deep pleasure and connection as a "burden."

Even if ruling classes didn't manipulate elections, how are people supposed to agree on any political issues when some people value deep pleasure, connection and having a meaningful life, and others consistently embrace superficiality and being a cog in a machine? And of course, child abuse or deprivation isn't all-or-nothing, with nearly everybody carrying at least some troubles from their childhood.

The war-resisters had grown up with a respectful childhood, so respect was the norm for them and they grew up with a deep personal strength. The war-volunteers had grown up in disrespectful houses with little loving touch, double standards, emotional and physical abuse, and more. In adulthood, they tolerated being a cog in a machine.

This is _not_ to say that "warriors are bad" or "war resistance is good." A nation must always be ready to defend itself when needed. The question is whether or not people develop the integrity and deep relationships needed to stand for what's right. Clearly when children are unable to heal from their abuse or deprivation, they can become adults willing to support disrespectful authorities.

Of course, not everyone trained for obedience becomes obedient. Some become people-pleasers, and others become self-centered. Every childhood is unique, and each child responds to their challenges in their own way. There are countless hurtful attitudes people can develop from disrespectful childhoods when they're unable to heal.

Abused people commonly abuse their children, and even many parents who mean well still act disrespectfully in ways they do not see due to their own emotional troubles. This is only compounded by the stresses many parents feel due to financial insecurity, relationship troubles, and other challenges. In this way, each generation trains the next to have emotional troubles that, over time, effectively train people to tolerate a disrespectful culture.

This shows how conquering is not a single event, but a continual process, and it involves lots of child abuse. Unfortunately, deep training for submissive obedience does not end in childhood, but continues throughout adulthood. How are adults trained to tolerate predatory behavior all around them?

### When Adults Learn to "Hold Back" or "Shut Down" Parts of Themselves

Julian Assange described how people learn to tolerate exploitation: "Every time we witness an injustice and do not act, we train our character to be passive in its presence and thereby eventually lose all ability to defend ourselves and those we love."

What qualities would people need to cultivate to have the strength to live in a healthy culture? And how are adults trained to tolerate living in an unhealthy culture with endless exploitation?

* _Integrity_: Every human has an urge to stand for what's right in solidarity with others, but this isn't allowed in unhealthy cultures where people are expected to obey the law but not uphold it. When people learn to ignore injustice or feel helpless to stop it, life can seem meaningless, and low integrity becomes common.

* _Bravery_: When the police punish anyone who tries to take a stand against abusive authorities, they arrest the bravest people and scare the rest into holding back, tolerating abusive behavior, and focusing on their own comfort and safety instead. When bravery is punished, cowardice becomes common.

* _Generosity_: Profit economies reward selfish, profit-seeking behavior rather than generosity.

* _Gratitude_: When people live in financial desperation, learn to fear or resent their neighbors, learn to tolerate injustice, struggle with childhood emotional wounds, and do not know how to receive the gifts of the Earth, it is easy to not feel deep gratitude for the gifts of life.

* _Human connection_: When authorities propagate racist, sexist, or hateful attitudes, punish people for upholding their own law, and sabotage solidarity movements, it becomes difficult to have deep, trusting, meaningful connections with many other people.**

* _Pleasure_: Many people who are deprived of abundant loving touch in childhood may feel displeasure, dissatisfaction or disconnection as a normal, baseline experience of life and struggle to feel deep pleasure. And many religions discourage deep pleasure.

* _Nature Connection_: Profit economies force people to seek money to survive, rather than build a mutually enriching relationship with the Earth.

* _Remembering_: Everybody has ancestors who lived in healthy cultures in the past, but most have forgotten and think their unhealthy culture is "just how life is."

* _Dignity_: Authoritarian religions train people to feel shame, disconnection from the divinity of life around and within us, belief in inherent badness or selfishness, displeasure, low self-worth, and other negative qualities.

* _Deep Awareness_: Unhealthy cultures often propagate hurtful racist or sexist assumptions, or rigid ideologies and dogmas about how life "should be," whether in economics, religion, or politics. People who get lulled into lazy or rigid thinking are easy to manipulate, so deep awareness is rare.

This shows why no one is inherently bad, selfish or hateful. Deep childhood wounds, commonly reinforced in adulthood, can train people to cultivate very hurtful attitudes. But hurtful qualities like selfishness or cowardice are not our nature as humans. They have to be taught.

For millions of years, every child was trained for beautiful qualities, in part so they would have the strength to stand for what's right in solidarity with others. Only in recent times have people been trained otherwise.

And what is the result? Endless predation!

To maintain this way of life, we are continually reconquered: our bravest, wisest, and most generous spiritual leaders are imprisoned or killed. We are trapped in financial desperation and surrounded by deceit in the news media. Authoritarian religions encourage all the worst qualities. Leaders propagate racist, sexist, and hateful attitudes, and force poor people to fight their wars so the rich get even richer. Solidarity movements are continually sabotaged. Selfishness is rewarded throughout the economy. And ongoing widespread childhood deprivation and abuse trains many people to support all this or resist ineffectively in countless different ways.

It is time to end the endless predation. This will require creating new healthy cultures. That is, we must create new nations where _everyone agrees on the laws and everyone bravely upholds them, taking humans' and nonhumans' needs into account_. You and the people around you can do this. What perspectives could help you succeed? Let us explore in _Part 3 - The Deepest Revolution_.
