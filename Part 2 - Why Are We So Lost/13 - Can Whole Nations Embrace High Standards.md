## Chapter 13: Can Whole Nations Embrace High Standards?

Authorities systematically train conquered people to accept submissive obedience as legitimate and normal. People with this mindset expect little of themselves and others. They don't expect life to be deeply meaningful or others to be reliably trustworthy. Instead, they learn to focus mostly on themselves and pleasing others to protect themselves, rather than standing for what's right. Many people engage in superficial or wishful thinking about social change, and even adopt the ideologies of their abusers.

The consequences of submissive obedience are devastating. Authorities create and maintain all sorts of systemic problems, including widespread corruption, racism, sexism, hatred, child abuse, and greed. Many people accept and then adopt these hurtful attitudes, beliefs and practices as their own, and nearly everyone accepts these problems as inevitable.

Without exception, every unhealthy nation has these intractable problems, and none of them exist in any healthy nation I've studied.

But our troubles go deeper still.

_A person's integrity is their willingness to stand for a culture of mutual respect, including being honest, keeping promises, having an attitude of service, and standing for justice._ But integrity becomes rare when people are forbidden from standing for justice and solidarity is continually sabotaged. Instead, low integrity, cowardice, low mutual understanding, superficiality, and low self-worth become common.

When people accept that corruption and greed are unavoidable aspects of their nation, they also come to think that these unwelcome personal qualities like cowardice and superficiality, while tragic, are unavoidable too. When these qualities start to seem normal, people's expectations or standards for themselves and others fall. After all, why expect deep integrity or generosity from anybody if you're just going to be let down?

But there is good news. It is possible to live without troubles like discrimination and corruption. It's also possible to live in a nation where everyone embraces integrity, bravery, and generosity so that neighbors can deeply trust each other. Many stories of healthy nations living in traditional times show how high our standards can be, and reveal how low our standards currently are.

The path to creating new healthy nations requires learning how to hold ourselves and others to high standards so that integrity, generosity, and other attractive qualities become common.

### Healthy Nations Show How High Our Standards Can Be

_Integrity:_ Every legal system around the world requires testifying under oath, and threatens people with severe punishment for lying. The assumption is that people can't be counted on to tell the truth unless they are afraid of being punished.

In contrast, integrity was so pervasive among the traditional Apache that no one was compelled to take an oath because, according to Geronimo, "it is not believed that they will give false testimony in a matter relating to their own people."[xxx-geronimo autobio|Unwritten Laws of the Apaches]

_Physical resilience:_ Crow woman Pretty Shield described how physically resilient her people used to be: "[W]hen I was young, if in winter a person fell into icy water, he got out, took off his wet clothes, and rolled in the snow, rubbing his body with it, and got warm. Then, after squeezing out the water, he put on his clothes and forgot about getting wet... Now my people wear gloves, and too many clothes. We are soft as mud."[xxx-red mother|p84]

_Generosity:_ A Christian missionary visited the Ojibway, Cheyenne, Cree and Sioux nations, describing how Jesus Christ selflessly gave away all his possessions, urged others to do the same, and dedicated his life to feeding, healing, and protecting his people. The missionary was told that, prior to colonization, Jesus Christ's level of selfless generosity was normal among them.[xxx-from deep woods to civilization|civ preached practiced]

_Meaningful Education for Young People:_ One Nootka storyteller described how the women would often have their moon time at the same time each month, and they would go to a special house and enjoy a four-day party. They would sit on special soft moss and give their blood back to the Earth and play games and talk. Women would massage each other and make special tea for cramps. This became a big opportunity for older women to mentor younger women. For example, young women learned the special Frog posture that could help relieve cramps and make childbirth easier.

_Benefitting the Earth:_ Stories abound of people of healthy nations benefitting or enriching the Earth as a normal way of life. Robin Kimmerer described how Black Ash trees actually became _more abundant_ in regions where it was respectfully harvested by Mohawk and Potawatomi basket makers, and this remains true today.[xxx-braiding sweetgrass|wisgaak gokpenagen] Apache man Stalking Wolf described how he respectfully harvested a sapling to make a powerful bow so that the overall forest also benefitted.[xxx-the vision|p81]

These are high standards. Total integrity is normal, and Jesus Christ's level of selfless generosity is considered normal too. Physical resilience and meaningful childhood education are also baseline expectations. Their normal way of life benefits the Earth around them, increasing the natural abundance that they depend on.

When people bring out the best in each other and hold each other to high standards, whole nations really can maintain a baseline of mutual respect among the people, and between people and the Earth.

Remember, members of nations such as the Potawatomi, Crow, Apache, and Nootka are people like anyone else. They have attitudes, skills and awareness that anyone could cultivate -- including you and other strong and caring people you know.

### Seeing the Trap of Low Standards

When people accept submissive obedience as normal, many unnecessary problems arise. These problems may seem inevitable, just part of the human experience. But in truth, they're only problems in unhealthy nations where people are trained not to hold themselves or each other to high standards.

#### Low Standards for Children

How adults treat kids and young adults offers many examples of low standards and the terrible problems that result. People in unhealthy nations often assume that it's normal and inevitable for teenagers to act rebelliously, or that teenage years have to be awkward and stressful. However, children in healthy nations are expected to take ever greater responsibility for themselves as they grow, becoming self-reliant by their teenage years or even contributing to their families.

When children are not raised from birth to follow this natural process toward maturity, they face a dilemma in their teenage years. Biologically, teens have a natural urge for independence, but most haven't been prepared for it by this age. Instead, the vast majority suffer through endless boring classes which prepare them for unfulfilling jobs later in life.

Healthy nations show how capable and confident children and young adults can be, and how teenage awkwardness and rebelliousness are merely symptoms of living in unhealthy nations.

Mart√≠n Prechtel describes how, among the Tzutujil Maya, both boys and girls were sufficiently mature and skilled to contribute to the family by the age of 12, carrying their own weight or more.[xxx-secrets of the talking jaguar|p99-100]

Young Nootka boys and girls were trained to have very strong physical endurance and very high standards. One Nootka woman storyteller said, "every day we had to get our bodies ready. So that when the time came to go from bein' a girl to bein' a woman, we'd be ready." Girls learned many skills including gathering fiber and weaving. When puberty arrived, the young woman would have a rite of passage where, after a big party with her family and friends, she dressed up in her finest clothes and was taken out into the ocean. Far from shore, she would strip down naked and dive into the ocean and the boat would leave her all alone. She would swim back to her family and friends who lit a fire on the beach for her return. As she approached, "they'd start to sing a victory song about how a girl went for a swim and a woman came home." Children raised with meaningful mentorship every day were ready for adulthood and other adults recognized it. When teenagers are treated respectfully, there is nothing to rebel against![xxx-daughters of copper woman|p101-102]

Many adults assume that young teenagers cannot be mature enough to have respectful sexual relationships, but this is only typically true in unhealthy nations. When children are raised to take responsibility for themselves and others, feel their feelings, understand risk, and have good boundaries, the Mosuo show that young adults can have respectful and joyful relationships as teenagers.[xxx-sex at dawn|love lust lagu]

When a Mosuo girl reaches puberty around 13 or 14, her new bedroom has two doors, one for the family to enter and one all her own so she can easily have lovers visit. One visitor described the young women as "sassy and confident," and noted the lack of "broken homes," impoverished single mothers, and shameful divorces.[xxx-sex at dawn|love lust lagu]

In unhealthy nations, a major obstacle to having many sexual relationships is the fear of pregnancy and becoming a parent before the person is ready. However, expecting the two sexual partners to be the sole parental figures for any child is unnecessarily limiting. Each Mosuo man knows from boyhood that he will be a parent figure for his sister's children, and this frees both men and women to have sex without worrying about which man fathered which child. Mosuo women know they will always have a family and parenting support regardless what happens with their sexual relationships, which takes a lot of pressure off of them. One Mosuo woman described how they share parental responsibilities: "In place of one father, Mosuo children have many uncles who take care of them... We also have many mothers, because we call our aunts... 'little mother.'" Others outside the family help too.[xxx-sex at dawn|love lust lagu]

This way of arranging parenting responsibilities allows both men and women to have sexual partners without worrying about who the biological father is, making it easier for both men and women to have more sex while ensuring children are well cared for. They created a way of life where men, women and children get their needs met without unnecessary sexual restrictions, and this helped young adults feel secure.[xxx-sex at dawn|love lust lagu]

Jean Liedloff acted as a physician among the Yequana, and she noted, "All [their] behaviour contradicted the assumptions I held about how children behave." A four-year-old came to her all alone with a gaping wound and kept his composure through the pain, and a 9-year-old came with an abdominal wound. There was no needless worry, and they didn't need sympathy. Even the 9-year-old's mother showed no anxiety. After all, everything that could be done to address the injury was being done. The boys recovered.[xxx-continuum concept|growing up]

Liedloff ascribed these children's emotional resilience and self-confidence to having sufficient time in their mother's arms in early childhood, being raised with healthy boundaries, and being corrected without guilt or shame after any mistake.[xxx-continuum concept|growing up]

She watched how, if a young child sullied the floor in the family's house, he would be told sternly to go outside and not to make a mess inside. Thus the adults set healthy boundaries, but "he is not told that he is bad or that he is always doing the wrong thing. He never feels he is bad, only, at most, that he is a loved child doing an undesirable act." Adults trusted that the children were good people who made a mistake, not bad people who needed to be shamed into obeying. Shame, insecurity, and emotional fragility were absent among the Yequana, including among children and teenagers.[xxx-continuum concept|growing up]

In unhealthy nations, troubles at the national level are reflected in many families. Adults who aren't allowed to take deep responsibility for their community or nation -- because they're not allowed to choose their laws or uphold them -- often struggle to raise children to take full responsibility for themselves and others. Adults who are not allowed to hold others, and especially their leaders, to high standards of good behavior struggle to respectfully hold children to high standards. Parents who are used to submissive obedience often expect the same from their children, or they may reject rules entirely and not hold firm respectful boundaries, tolerating careless or disrespectful behavior. None of these attitudes teach children how to have good boundaries or high standards.

<div class="rev-act"><div class="rev-act-header">Revolutionary Activity #22<br/>Hold firm boundaries without encouraging shame or guilt</div>
<div class="rev-act-body">Next time someone acts hurtfully towards you or someone you care about, acknowledge the problematic behavior, the impact it had, and what behavior you would rather see. Do not put the other person down or make any hurtful or dismissive comments to them. Trust that they want to know if they made a mistake and will grow from the experience. Many people are not used to being treated this way, with both respect and healthy boundaries, so be ready to help them understand what you expect of them. If they truly are not willing to hold themselves to a high standard, you will see this clearly, and you can decide not to cooperate any more.</div></div>

#### Low Standards for Politics

Low standards are pervasive everywhere in unhealthy nations, especially in politics. 

Politicians may brag about being "tough on crime," but they never talk about _ending crime._ Ending crime would require people to create a healthy nation like the Mosuo, who have so little crime that their language has no words for "murder" or "rape."[xxx-sex at dawn|love lust lagu]

Many citizens in democracies care deeply about their society but knowingly vote for evil candidates anyway as "the lesser evil." How can people think they're free if they can only choose between more or less evil political leaders? At its root, "evil" means "corrupt" or "selfish," describing someone who prioritizes their own needs at the expense of the group.

Even so-called liberation movements will be disappointing as long as people accept their submissive obedience as legitimate.

For example, black people and women were both treated abominably in the United States at the start of the 1900s, facing severe discrimination in the workplace, courtroom, and other areas of life. After more than a century of "women's liberation" and "black liberation" movements, what is the result? Women and black people can now become corrupt politicians, just like they can be selfish rich business owners, corrupt judges and police officers, and well-paid wage slaves.

Women and black people have essentially been offered a smaller serving of the same bad deal that white men have had since the United States' founding: if you're willing to embrace selfishness and sacrifice your integrity, you too can have a comfortable position in your corrupt society, and even a small chance at getting rich. Plenty of women and black people have taken this deal, just like many white men have taken it for centuries. In practice, these were movements not to seek liberation, but to increase people's privilege and reduce the abuse they faced.

Since the United States remains an unhealthy nation, and _every_ unhealthy nation _always_ has racism and sexism, these troubles persist today. When people accept submissive obedience as normal, they will even have low standards for liberation movements.

Instead of seeking real freedom, authorities trick people into thinking that "freedom" means being able to do whatever you want, so the way to become free is to get rich. But this is faux-freedom, the ability to act selfishly without restraint. No matter how rich you get, you still won't be allowed to stand for justice. You'll just have a more comfortable place in an abusive society.

Real freedom comes when everyone in a nation stands for what's right as a normal way of life, so everyone enjoys justice, shared resources, protection, and respect among their neighbors.

I certainly do _not_ suggest anyone quit their job. However, "climbing the ladder" to get better-paying jobs is not the path to freedom. The further up the ladder you climb, the further you are from _the most secure feeling in the world_ -- the priceless security that comes from living in a supportive, respectful, generous community that you trust has your back.

Revolutionaries like the Black Panthers and Zapatistas often kept working their jobs as they sought to free their people. Black Panther Don Cox put it well: "use what you got to get what you need."[xxx-just another nigger|use what you got] Making money shouldn't be the end-goal. Just like the Tzutujil Mayans and Huron who liked to get rich so they could give it all away, make money so you can do the most good in service of the people and nonhumans you love.

#### Low Standards for Women

Unhealthy nations consistently train people to idolize the rich and powerful, and this has caused many women to have low standards for women leaders. Many parents encourage their daughters to pretend to be a princess and fantasize about being royalty, even though kings and queens consistently exploit the people they rule.

Many young women aspire to leadership positions in politics, but corrupt women politicians are no better than corrupt men. British prime minister Margaret Thatcher oppressed labor unions,[xxx-conversation thatcher] and American secretary of state Hillary Clinton approved extra weapons sales to countries that bribed her, even while State Department reports described those countries' many human rights abuses.[xxx-clinton corrupt]

Selfish women business executives can likewise do just as much harm as selfish men, leading corporations that produce vast amounts of toxic chemicals[xxx-lubrizol ceo] or lobby for needless wars while supplying the weapons.[xxx-opensecrets capitalizing on conflict]<sup>,</sup>[xxx-lockheedmartin.com ceo]

A common theme in healthy nations is _balance,_ ensuring both women and men have positions of influence without corruption. Male and female partners usually served as Tzutujil Mayan chiefs together.[xxx-secrets of the talking jaguar|p202]

The traditional Cherokee had a White Council of women who led during peacetime and a Red Council of men who led in war. Cherokee woman Rebecca Adamson said, "The goal was the balance, the harmony, the bringing together of both wisdoms and both energies for the good of the Nation."[xxx-original instructions|first nations survival]

In the Haudenosaunee Confederacy, a clan mother selects a male leadership candidate who goes through several stages of approval. Her entire clan must support him, then the council of leaders must approve, and finally anyone in the Confederacy may veto if he or she has doubts. If the candidate does not pass any stage, the clan mother finds someone else, ensuring that every leadership candidate has the support of a trusted elder woman.[xxx-original instructions|a democracy based on peace]

There are many ways for wise and capable women to serve their people. But neither men nor women politicians will address the deepest injustices as long as the nation has low standards.

#### Low Standards for Men

Masculine mentors in healthy nations consistently emphasize two qualities: integrity and bravery. These are qualities for everyone to embrace, and they are repeated often when men train boys.

Nez Perce chief Joseph's advice to an American boy was simple: "be brave and tell the truth."[xxx-joseph brave truth|p336] Wikis' Cheyenne uncle likewise taught him there was "one thing more important than anything else, and that is to be brave... If you do that, the people will all know of it, and will look on you as a man." He also said, "always be truthful and honest with all your people."[xxx-when buffalo ran|lessons prairie]

Men of healthy nations show what it's like to live with total integrity and bravery, and they reveal just how far from this high standard most men in unhealthy nations typically live.

Apache man Geronimo described how young men were expected to show "no color of cowardice, or weakness of any kind." All boys were trained to be warriors who would protect their people. Geronimo stated the minimal, entry-level requirement: "[once the youth] has proven beyond question that he can bear hardships without complaint, and that he is a stranger to fear, he is admitted to the council of the warriors in the lowest rank."[xxx-geronimo autobio|preparation of a warrior] Young men had to cultivate this depth of bravery to be considered ready for marriage.[xxx-geronimo autobio|family]

Huron men intentionally practiced bravery throughout their adult lives so they would be ready to protect their people from any injustice or threat. This included intentionally causing themselves pain to practice maintaining composure under duress.[xxx-huron farmers of the north|44]

Jean Liedloff was impressed by the strong, positive male presence she witnessed in Yequana households which she described as relaxed, peaceful and serene. The men were not permissive, holding everyone to the highest standards, and boys loved to measure themselves against their fathers. Everyone took "pride in doing their best, in living up to the men's expectations as well as to one another's... By his behaviour, his own dignity and excellence in what he does, he shows their society's ways to the young."[xxx-continuum concept|growing up]

Sioux man Ohiyesa described how he was trained not to care for money or possessions, "because a true Indian always shares whatever he may possess." He said, "We never [had] any money... we valued nothing except honor." Sioux men would bravely share their last food with a hungry neighbor.[xxx-from deep woods to civilization|the way opens]

Women often ask _where are all the good men?_ In feminist literature around the world, this is a common question going back to the dawn of unhealthy nations.[xxx-odoc|ch47]

I did not know what a good man was until I studied healthy nations where boys are raised to consistently practice integrity and bravery, becoming good men willing to confront any injustice or threat to their people.

Stories from healthy nations show what it's like when women can trust all the men. One Cheyenne boy named Wikis was 5 or 6 years old when his village was suddenly attacked, and men instantly ran towards the threat while women gathered the children. Wikis said, "My mother rushed out and caught me by the hand... and then she stopped and in a shrill, sweet voice began to sing; and other women that were running about stopped too, and began to sing songs to encourage their husbands and brothers and sons to fight bravely; for enemies were attacking the camp..."[xxx-when buffalo ran|attack on the camp] The women would not have sung for untrustworthy men.

All these stories show how low our standards for men are. When boys are trained for submissive obedience, they are trained for cowardice instead of bravery and humiliation instead of dignity. This upbringing trains boys to "hold back" or "shut down" core parts of themselves, becoming spiritually lost as they do not know how to relate to themselves and the world in a good way.

Boys are raised to ignore their humiliation and cowardice so it seems normal. Some grow up to be people-pleasers who stand for nothing, just keeping life easy. Others become selfish, standing only for themselves. That Martin Luther King Jr and Jesus Christ are so revered shows how rare profoundly good men are in unhealthy nations.

Spiritually lost men may preen on social media, flaunt their wealth, or spend vast hours playing video games. Some men live vicariously by watching movies or professional sports, or they focus on superficial hobbies or making money, or obsess over political and religious dogmas.

In 1877, the American military captured some Cheyenne women and children. The very next day, 500 Lakota and Cheyenne warriors launched an attack to try to retrieve them.[xxx-black elk speaks|footnotes] Women and children suffer many sexual and physical assaults in unhealthy nations -- where are the good men who would band together to stop this?

Men who have been systematically trained to deny their feelings and not to follow their sacred path may abandon their family or beat them, or get lost in drugs or alcohol. Even among men who avoid these troubles, how many boys feel grateful to their fathers for holding them to high standards? How many girls feel grateful to their fathers for showing them what a good man is like? Too few!

Some men join the police or military where they pretend to serve the public while obediently taking orders from unaccountable leaders, so they actually protect the rich and powerful. Authorities consistently threaten the careers and even lives of brave police whistleblowers who call out the police's own illegal activity, scaring the remaining officers into submissive obedience.[xxx-odoc|ch32]

Behind this superficiality, many men struggle with nagging questions like "when does life become meaningful?" or "why am I even here?" As Henry David Thoreau put it, "The mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation."[xxx-walden|economy] This also explains the saying that "Every man dies. Not every man really lives."[xxx-braveheart every man]

Living a life of submissive obedience is not satisfying. Tolerating injustice and meaningless work is not satisfying. Debating politics while pretending that the whole system isn't corrupt is not satisfying. Living with low standards is not satisfying.

Men have a deep urge towards freedom, but few know what freedom even means because they have been systematically misled and poorly trained from birth. Unhealthy nations don't raise boys to be good men because good men would protect their people from oppression and lead them to freedom, and this is forbidden.

To male readers, I say this: It is time to raise our standards. Cultivate your integrity and bravery, and make friends with others who also hold themselves to a high bar. There's a reason healthy nations train men to prefer a brave death to a humiliating long life. Tolerating humiliation leads to all the troubles of abusive nations. You would live longer but feel half dead inside.

Of course, in unhealthy nations some amount of submissiveness is required in order to survive. The Deepest Revolution requires the bravery and integrity to strategically choose when to submit and when to take a stand to do the most good. When you value and cultivate these qualities with others who hold each other to high standards, you will grow a depth of spiritual strength that few men in unhealthy nations ever achieve.

The path for a group to build a new healthy nation and live in freedom will require everyone to hold themselves and others to high standards. To do this, we must learn how to spiritually grow without feeling guilt or shame.

### To Have High Standards, Learn to Grow Without Guilt or Shame

Feelings of shame and guilt are some of the biggest obstacles to spiritual growth. They can also make a person resistant to receiving feedback from others, making it difficult for people to hold each other to high standards of behavior. People may resist feedback because they have been taught to feel shameful and guilty in the past, or treated unfairly, and don't want this to happen again. Others may have subconscious shame or guilt from childhood that gets triggered, creating automatic insecurity and defensiveness.

Therefore, to effectively hold yourself and others to high standards and help people grow from their mistakes, learn how to pursue personal and collective growth without shame or guilt.

A key requirement is to have the attitude that, when someone lets you down, they are a _good person making a mistake,_ not a bad person being bad. Trust that they want to show up in a good way and just don't know how. There's something they're missing, but if they could see it, they would learn and show up better.

Some people are so stuck that they don't grow even with repeated respectful feedback, and you may need to set boundaries and not allow their hurtful behavior in your life or community anymore. But if someone acts hurtfully and you start with the attitude that they're "bad," they will be resistant to any feedback that you offer.

<div class="rev-act"><div class="rev-act-header">Revolutionary Activity #23<br/>Learn without guilt or shame</div>
<div class="rev-act-body">Think of a time you made a mistake and you felt guilty or shameful in response, perhaps because an adult urged you to feel this way. How much harder did those feelings make it to learn from your mistake? How helpful would it have been if the person trusted that you wanted to learn from the experience? Next time you make a mistake, learn what you can, notice any feelings of guilt or shame, and just let them go.</div></div>

#### Everything is a Skill That Can be Practiced Without Guilt or Shame

Think of a skill you learned as a child. Imagine, for example, that you learned to ride a bike, including smaller skills such as steering or peddling. To get better at steering, what did you do?

You practiced: you tried your best to ride straight, and sometimes you went straight and sometimes you didn't. When you made a mistake, you figured out what to learn and then practiced more. The more you practiced, the more proper technique became normal.

Integrity, awareness, gratitude, and generosity are also skills, and you can practice them intentionally too. Practice approaching life with these qualities, and notice when you fall short. Practice being aware of yourself whenever you make a mistake, such as ignoring certain feelings or being afraid to tell the truth and lying instead.

It is ok to feel disappointed if you fall short. But if you feel insecure or like you are inherently bad or not good enough, this is unhelpful shame. If this feeling arises, acknowledge it and let it go. Just recognize that you made a mistake, learn from it, and do better next time. If you disappointed someone else, acknowledge your mistake, do your best to make it right, learn any lessons you can, and commit to doing better. You are just practicing and learning.

And just like you practiced steering before going for a long bike ride, you can practice these beautiful qualities outside the normal flow of life. For example, bravery is the ability to remain conscious and do what you know is right even if you feel uncomfortable or afraid. To practice, put yourself in uncomfortable or scary situations and practice maintaining your composure. If you're scared of dancing, face your fear and go dancing. If cold water feels uncomfortable, practice keeping your composure in cold water. Learn to feel _comfortable in the midst of discomfort_ so that nothing causes you to ever "hold back" or "shut down" parts of yourself.

The book _One Disease One Cure_ contains many more suggestions for cultivating bravery, integrity, and other qualities.

Spiritual growth can be joyful rather than stressful when you approach it without shame and guilt, as part of a group of friends that bring out the best in each other. As long as you're truly committed to that path of spiritual growth, mistakes are simply learning opportunities along the way.

For me, "spirituality" means how you relate to yourself and the world. Thus, "spiritual growth" means learning to relate to yourself and the world in a better way, including with integrity, awareness, bravery, joy, generosity, respect for the Earth, and healthy personal boundaries. The three core spiritual practices lead to spiritual growth by helping you relate to the world with gratitude, by identifying and giving your sacred gifts, and living in reciprocity.

Recognizing two complementary truths will accelerate your spiritual growth. First, _you are already perfect,_ even with all your faults. Second, _you have unmet potential,_ and you must strive to fulfill it to give your deepest love. The first truth is about self-acceptance, and the second is about growth.

Self-acceptance is the foundation for spiritual growth, so your growth will be limited without it. If you feel self-doubt or low self-worth, focus on total self-acceptance. You are perfect as you are now, faults and all, and you're basically ok. With this self-acceptance, see your unmet potential, and grow to meet it.

When you hold yourself to high standards, your rate of growth will increase. You won't waste time feeling shame and guilt. You will just notice your mistakes, learn from them, and move on.

These shame-free and guilt-free attitudes to spiritual growth are essential. Embrace them to hold yourself and others to high standards and create relationships of deep trust, where qualities like integrity, bravery, awareness, and generosity are normal.

<div class="rev-act"><div class="rev-act-header">Revolutionary Activity #24<br/>Practice bravery</div>
<div class="rev-act-body">Consistently facing your fears is one key way to cultivate bravery. Think of a fear that you're avoiding right now. You may have lied and you're afraid to admit it, or you're afraid to quit an unsatisfying job. Face your fear, recognize that you can handle whatever comes, and do what you need to do.</div></div>
