## Why Do People Have Such Low Standards?

### Healthy Nations Show How High our Standards Can Be

_Integrity:_ In every legal system around the world, people are required to testify under oath, and they are threatened with severe punishment for lying. The assumption is that participants might lie if they weren't scared.

In contrast, integrity was so pervasive among the traditional Apache that they did not compel anyone to take an oath because, according to Geronimo, "it is not believed that they will give false testimony in a matter relating to their own people."[xxx-geronimo autobio|Unwritten Laws of the Apaches]

Can you imagine if there was no need for an oath to tell the truth, because people in your group already expected total honesty from each other as a normal way of life?

_Physical resilience:_ Crow woman Pretty Shield described how physically resilient her people were when they lived in a traditional way. She said, "Ahh, my people were tough in those days... [W]hen I was young, if in winter a person fell into icy water, he got out, took off his wet clothes, and rolled in the snow, rubbing his body with it, and got warm. Then, after squeezing out the water, he put on his clothes and forgot about getting wet... Now my people wear gloves, and too many clothes. We are soft as mud."[xxx-red mother|p84]

Can you imagine if the people around you were so physically resilient that even being soaking wet in winter was nothing to worry about, but just a little trouble to fix?

_Generosity:_ A Christian missionary once visited men of the Ojibway, Cheyenne, Cree and Sioux nations, and he described Jesus Christ's selfless generosity. Christ gave away all his possessions and urged others to do the same while dedicating his life to feeding, healing, and protecting his people. The missionary was told that, prior to colonization, Jesus Christ's level of selfless generosity was simply normal among them.[xxx-from deep woods to civilization|civ preached practiced]

Can you imagine living in a nation where someone like Jesus Christ was considered admirable but not unusual because such selfless generosity is simply normal and expected?

_Meaningful Education for Young People:_ One Nootka storyteller described how the women would often have their moon time at the same time each month, and they would go to a special house and enjoy a four-day party. They would sit on special soft moss and give their blood back to the Earth and play games and talk. Women would rub each others' back and make special tea if someone had cramps. This became a major opportunity for older women to mentor younger women. For example, young women learned the special Frog posture that could help relieve cramps and make childbirth easier.

Can you imagine if adults took young people's education seriously, offering them the most meaningful mentorship they could every day?

_Benefitting the Earth:_ Stories abound of people of healthy nations actually benefitting the Earth as a normal way of life rather than depleting it. Robin Kimmerer described how Black Ash trees actually became _more abundant_ in regions where it was respectfully harvested by Mohawk and Potawatomi basket makers, and this remains true today.[xxx-braiding sweetgrass|wisgaak gokpenagen] Apache man Stalking Wolf described how he respectfully harvested a sapling to make a bow so that the overall forest benefitted, and the chosen tree yielded a powerful bow.[xxx-the vision|p81]

Can you imagine if your normal way of life benefitted the Earth around you, increasing the natural abundance that you depend on?

When people bring out the best in each other, have high expectations, or hold each other to high standards, we really are capable of maintaining that baseline of mutual respect among each other, and between people and the Earth.

Remember, members of nations such as the Potawatomi, Ojibway, Apache, and Nootka are people like anyone else. They have attitudes, skills and awareness that anyone could cultivate -- including you and the people around you.

Regardless of the unhealthy nation in which you may now live, you can hold yourself and others to a high standard of integrity. You and the people around you could cultivate physical resilience, mentor young people in a good way, and learn how to receive the Earth's gifts in a way that actually benefits the Earth.

This is the path to building a culture of deep trust. Have high expectations for yourself and the people around you so that qualities like integrity, bravery, awareness, and generosity are simply normal and expected.

<div class="rev-act-body">Think of a time when someone had faith in you, maybe even more faith than you had in yourself. Did someone help you find the self-respect to leave an abusive romantic relationship? Did a coach help you cultivate the discipline to train at your sport and be the best you could be? Did a teacher help you realize you could be great at whatever you put your mind to? If this mentor did their job properly, they did not shame or punish you, but helped you see your unmet potential and urged you to reach it -- to be your best self, and not settle for less. Think of an example like this where someone really brought out the best in you, holding you to a high standard.<br/><br/>Watch for an instance where someone lets themselves or others down. Perhaps they lie to someone or to themselves, or give up on a big goal too easily, or tolerate an unsatisfying relationship or job without even trying to change it. One way or another, help them find the strength to show up better.</div></div>

<div class="rev-act-body">Oftentimes, when one person feels upset by another, they'll express themselves but not communicate very clearly or very respectfully. Whenever someone expresses anger or frustration with you, or offers you constructive feedback, actively look for the lesson to learn so that you can grow from the experience. Repeat the lesson back to them, to ensure both you and the other person agree on it. This ensures you heard them properly, and that you only learn lessons that you agree with. Do what you can to make it easy rather than difficult for others to give you constructive feedback if they see you making a mistake.</div></div>

#### Seeing the Trap of Low Standards

When people are conquered, they may be tempted to accept their own submissive obedience as legitimate and normal. When a person or group tolerates their own obedient submission, they stop expecting much of themselves or others. People don't really expect life to be deeply meaningful, or don't trust others, or learn to focus mostly on themselves or pleasing others instead of standing for what's right. People may engage in superficial or wishful thinking, and may even adopt the ideologies of their abusers.

Widespread low standards and low expectations have many tragic consequences for both men and women.

One of the biggest examples of low standards is clear in a single question I keep hearing: _where are all the good men?_ In feminist literature around the world, this is a common question going back to the dawn of unhealthy nations.[xxx-odoc|ch47]

For years, I didn't understand the question, "where are all the good men?" I didn't know what a good man was until I studied healthy nations where boys are consistently raised to be good men who stand for what's right and bravely protect their people from harm. Stories of profoundly trustworthy men and trusting women from the Crow, Cheyenne, and Lakota showed me that all the men of a nation can be trustworthy.[xxx-odoc|ch47]

A core masculine gift is that of setting boundaries, especially protecting one's people from threats. In all nations, few things inspire men more than the need to protect their people from danger. And yet, in unhealthy nations, the rulers are the greatest threat to the people. The greatest threat is not from outside; it is within the nation itself, and neither men nor women are allowed to do anything about that.

Abusive nations raise boys not to honor their innate spiritual calling to protect their people from threats as a gift of love, without any compensation or orders. Instead, men commonly grow up learning to tolerate, ignore, or perpetuate abuse. People may join the police or military, but they just have to follow orders too.

When boys are raised to deny or twist this deep love-gift of boundary-setting and protection, unhealthy nations wind up with deeply spiritually confused men who ask questions like "When does life become meaningful?" or "Why am I even here?"

This explains the spiritual meaning behind Henry David Thoreau's comment that "The mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation."[xxx-walden|economy] It also explains the famous statement that "Every man dies. Not every man really lives."[xxx-braveheart every man] Living a life where a person has learned to hold back their love, afraid to stand for what's right, is deeply unsatisfying.

Of course, women can set boundaries and protect their people too. And yet, when this protective boundary-setting is forbidden in unhealthy nations, many men become spiritually lost, struggling to know how to live in a deeply satisfying way.

People endlessly debate the meaning of "toxic masculinity," and this perspective gets to the heart of the trouble: unhealthy nations do not train boys to be good men, because good men stand for what's right and protect their people from any threat, and authorities forbid this. Boys learn to cope with this deep trouble in a variety of ways. Some become selfish or become people pleasers, or distract themselves from their meaningless life with things like alcohol, drugs, superficial hobbies, or overwork.

Women in unhealthy nations may become spiritually lost too, such as those who believe women can be "liberated" by becoming well-paid wage slaves, selfish executives and corrupt politicians, just like spiritually lost men.

Instead of seeking real freedom, authorities in unhealthy nations trick men and women into thinking that "freedom" means being able to do whatever you want without financial restraint, and so the way to become free is to get rich. But this is the faux-freedom of kings who don't care about anyone.

Real freedom comes when everyone cares for and protects each other and stands for what's right as a normal way of life, so that everyone can enjoy justice and deep respect with their neighbors. When people forget this and just look after themselves, it's easy to become spiritually lost and let selfishness take over.

I certainly do _not_ suggest anyone quit their job. Just realize that individuals trying to get better-paying jobs is not the path to collective freedom. 

Revolutionaries like the Black Panthers and Zapatistas often kept working their jobs to support themselves as they sought to free their people. Black Panther Don Cox put it well: "use what you got to get what you need."[xxx-just another nigger|use what you got] Making money and getting rich shouldn't be the end-goal. Just like the Tzutujil Mayans and Huron who liked to get rich so they could give it all away, or Harriet Tubman who saved up money so she could return South to help others escape chattel slavery, I support people in making money so they can do the most good in service of the people and nonhumans they love.

When you know what to look for, you will see how low our expectations are for each other in unhealthy nations. But it doesn't need to be this way. To create healthy communities and eventually sovereign healthy nations, we need to raise our standards!
