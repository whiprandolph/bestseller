## Chapter 9: Why Do People Obey Corrupt Leaders?

The shared core experience of having a ruling class is simple: you must obey their laws whether you like them or not. Even if you like their laws, you are not allowed to uphold those laws -- if you do, you will be punished for intervening to ensure justice when someone behaves badly. Like it or not, you must follow the rulers and their lower authorities, even if you don't trust them or like their leadership.

Following corrupt, unaccountable leaders is considered a normal part of life in unhealthy cultures: people don't choose their bosses at work, don't choose their commanders in the military, and don't really choose their political leaders, because even in democracies politicians run and win based primarily on money, and therefore they are effectively chosen by the rich.

My question is: _how on Earth do so many people think it is OK to obediently follow the rules of corrupt leaders?_ How did so many unhealthy cultures get to the point where people submissively obey laws they don't agree with and corrupt authorities they don't like, and then accept their own obedience as legitimate and normal?

It turns out, the training for submissive obedience starts early and runs deep. To unravel this, I invite you to see things from a ruler's perspective.

### Ancient and Modern Religious Training for Submissive Obedience

If you were a king, and you wanted to train your subjects to obey you, what would you do? For starters, you would want to train your subjects to not stand up for what's right, and instead to passively accept your laws and how you choose to enforce them (or not).

And what would be a highly effective way of accomplishing that? How about imposing a religion that trained your subjects to believe that obeying authorities was good and morally right, and disobeying was evil and bad? 

Every religion has aspects of wisdom and beauty. However, when ruling classes impose an ideology or religion, they consistently twist or distort this ancient wisdom and beauty so that people learn to submit to authorities instead of personally stand for what's right. Unfortunately, this is essentially why religions like Christianity, Islam, and Buddhism consistently train people for submissive obedience.

This is sensitive stuff and I want to assure you that I am sticking to the known facts from recorded history. Christianity was first imposed on ancient Rome by Roman emperor Theodosius in 380 CE, and he threatened severe punishment to anyone who didn't convert. And what does the official Christian Bible say? According to 1-Peter 2:13: "Submit yourselves for the Lord's sake to every authority instituted among men: whether to the king, as the supreme authority, or to governors..."

Islamic rulers have also propagated this same pro-obedience ideology in their religion. The Quran says, "O believers! Obey Allah and obey the Messenger and those in authority among you." And of course, plenty of other authoritarian religions train people to believe that god says to obey their rulers.

The trouble runs deeper though. In abusive relationships, the abuser will often try to control the victim by lowering the victim's self-esteem in various ways -- by making them doubt themselves and doubt their own senses, by shaming and belittling them, by training the victim to think they're lucky to live with the abuser and would be worse off on their own. Abusers may train victims to think abuse is normal in relationships, and victims deserve what they get. Not surprisingly, victims who believe these things are more likely to tolerate abuse and stay in abusive relationships instead of leaving them.

Unhealthy cultures all have a ruling class that exploits the rest, so all unhealthy cultures create and maintain massive, multi-generational abusive relationships. The rulers are the ultimate abusers, with many lower authorities in religion, business, politics, and other areas also abusing or exploiting others. 

In unhealthy cultures -- just like in abusive domestic relationships between two people -- abusive authorities commonly impose ideologies that encourage things like shame, low self-worth, disconnection from divinity, fear of one's core instincts, rejection of pleasure, sexism, beliefs that humans are inherently selfish and untrustworthy, and beliefs that people deserve to suffer.

Self-respecting people do not passively submit to abusive authorities, but when people deeply embrace these hurtful attitudes or beliefs, they can become more willing to accept abuse, isolation, dissatisfaction, apathy, meaninglessness, superficiality, or despair.

For example, the Catholic Church's official dogma states that humans are "inclined to sin" and have "an inclination to evil." Still one of the most followed religions in the world, Catholicism states that the first human (Adam) "lost the original holiness and justice he had received from God, not only for himself but for all human beings."

And it's not just humans who are inherently bad or evil. Catholic dogma states that human sin "put the world as a whole in the sinful condition." This message that humans are born without holiness, inclined to evil, and disconnected from divinity is deeply shameful and discouraging.

And it gets worse -- apparently we were born into a sinful world that our sinful ways helped create! What message could possibly encourage more hopelessness?

The Islamic Quran likewise causes people to doubt their own sense of right and wrong, and to trust authorities instead. The Quran repeatedly states Allah's omniscience: "Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful... Surely Allah is Almighty, All-Wise... And Allah is All-Hearing, All-Knowing." The Quran paints the Islamic God Allah as omniscient, and how should a person respond if they have a feeling, urge, or thought that does not align with their authorities' religious text? The Quran is clear: "Perhaps you dislike something which is good for you and like something which is bad for you. Allah knows and you do not know."

Buddhist authorities have pulled the same authority-supporting tricks. Visitors to Tibet prior to the Chinese takeover in the 1950s found Tibetan Buddhists teaching that the world is full of evil. Every bend of the road, stream crossing, or village entrance had to have a row of flags to exorcize evil spirits. Lakes, wells, and streams teamed with demons who brought floods and hail storms upon anyone who violated their religious leaders' rules.

Evil could exist almost anywhere, from doorways to cracks in stones, and -- surprise, surprise -- only the priests could protect people from evil, for a fee of course. This ideology scared people away from the wilderness, seeing nonhumans as evil spirits rather than as their teachers and siblings, offering their gifts. This further trained people to live in fear and kept them in poverty.

Even the Tibetan Buddhist belief in karma has been used to excuse extreme exploitation by rich monks and lamas. The fourteenth Dalai Lama implied that serfs clearly deserve their suffering when he said, "A poor Tibetan was less inclined to envy or resent his Tibetan landlord because he knew that each of them was reaping the seed he had sown in his previous life."

Why would rulers deliberately push these attitudes and beliefs? Do you think it's a coincidence that these attitudes and beliefs discourage the spiritual strength and collective solidarity that might allow people to free themselves by uniting, making their own respectful laws, and upholding those laws together?

This may seem like a stretch for many people to believe, but it sure looks to me like this is no coincidence. Sadly there is even more evidence to back this up.

Have you noticed that authoritarian religions also tend to discourage deep sensual pleasure? Buddhism offers a clear example. The Buddha laid out the Four Noble Truths. Of these, the second is the Noble Truth of the Cause of Suffering, which is "craving that causes rebirth and is bound up with pleasure and lust and finds delight now here, now there. That is, the craving for sensual pleasures." The third is the "Noble Truth of the Cessation of Suffering" which "is the complete fading away and destruction of this very craving... the liberation from it, leaving no place for it." Thus Buddhism equates desire with suffering, and especially the desire for sensual pleasures. Renouncing one's desire for sensual pleasures is supposedly the path to ending suffering.

Religion is a major way rulers have imposed sexism. Authoritarian religions commonly teach divisive sexism, discouraging solidarity between men and women by training men to see themselves as superior and training women to submit. The Islamic Quran notes that "Men are the caretakers of women, as men have been provisioned by Allah over women... And righteous women are devoutly obedient..." The Christian Bible says, "I [God] would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman is the man." Tibetan Buddhist authorities, prior to the 1951 Chinese takeover, stated that working women were bad luck, and "among ten women you'll find nine devils."

If these holy books really are the word of an all-powerful god, then who could argue with them? But what if these religions and "holy" books are simply ideologies imposed on conquered people over many centuries, directly and indirectly training them for obedience?

It doesn't look good, does it?

Tragically, even many non-religious ideologies encourage hurtful attitudes. For example, in my economics classes in college, I was taught that humans are basically selfish, and this is good because the "invisible hand of the market" will organize people and channel their selfishness into productive activities that are good for capitalist society.

Authoritarian ideologies train people to doubt their instincts, or see obedience as good, or believe they're disconnected from God, evil, shameful, inherently selfish or bad, or only conditionally good (if they obey authority figures). The list of hurtful beliefs is long!

And if people really are so terrible, then of course it's foolish to trust one's neighbors. Thus these beliefs discourage trust too.

Of course, once people have decided to submit, and forgotten what real freedom is like, rulers historically have tricked them into thinking they're free. That's why the USA calls itself "the land of the free and home of the brave," and the Christian Bible and Islamic Quran urge Christians and Muslims around the world to believe they are free even while obeying their authorities. Focusing on economic "freedom" instead, the Soviet Union's government claimed it was fostering a revolutionary workers' paradise. And yet these are all merely different dictatorships, where a few people dictate the law and everyone else is expected to obey it.

And what are the results of these hurtful religions and ideologies? Unhealthy cultures around the world seem "just how life is" to countless inhabitants, including Americans, Chinese, Iraqis, Koreans, and others.

People learn to accept their obedience as normal. When people demand more jobs, less taxes, or more funding for schools or hospitals, what they're essentially demanding is that their authorities please rule them better or more efficiently.

Most citizens may think they are "good," or trying to "do their part." They may take all sorts of unproductive actions, such as voting, having unproductive political arguments with neighbors, worrying about their life after death, "praying" intensely by thinking thoughts in their head, or waiting for a prophet to be reborn and save them. People may do almost anything other than the one thing that could actually improve their spiritual, emotional, and physical lives immensely: _come together in solidarity, create their own laws, and uphold them to create new healthy cultures_.

I grew up as a Christian, believing in Jesus and God, and it was difficult for me to accept the perspectives in this chapter. But it helped me to remember that there is wisdom in every culture and religion. I can keep the wisdom I've found by studying Jesus Christ, Buddha, and Mohammad, and I am free to leave the hurtful or unhelpful aspects of these religions behind.

Many authorities insist that their religion or ideology is "all or nothing" -- you either believe everything, or you're cast out as an unbeliever. But that is simply bullying, pressuring people to adopt hurtful beliefs or attitudes just to stay in good standing in their community. Each of us has the power and the responsibility to choose which perspectives we embrace, and which ones we will not.

### We are Trained to Misunderstand our Spiritual Leaders

Religious authorities can distort or hide important aspects of history by controlling the contents of holy books like the Bible, Torah, and Quran, and by choosing which aspects of those books to emphasize. This has led to some very deep manipulation. For example, authorities have hid the true nature of Jesus Christ from Christian followers for nearly 2,000 years now.

Let's start with the obvious: while Christian authorities consistently emphasize the importance of obedience, Jesus Christ was extremely disobedient. Instead of merely obeying the law, Christ consistently stood for what's right _even in violation of the law_. He had the spiritual strength to stand for what's right, even at great personal risk -- even knowing he would die for serving his people.

Some Christians claim that Christ was obedient because he said, "Render unto Caesar that which is Caesar's," suggesting people should pay their taxes. But revolutionaries commonly debate whether to pay their taxes. Do you pay taxes to avoid harassment, so you can focus on liberating your people? Or do you choose not to support a corrupt government and face the consequences? Christ clearly was one of these revolutionaries who chose to pay taxes while seeking to liberate his people. Consider how incredibly disobedient Jesus Christ was:

* _Fed people illegally:_ Jesus Christ illegally fed hungry people on the sabbath.

* _Healed people illegally:_ Christ illegally healed people on the sabbath.

* _Prioritized doing the right thing over following the law:_ When religious-legal authorities reminded him of the law, Christ said that taking care of people was more important than the law, saying, "The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath."[xxx-bible mark 2:27] In other words, when people are in need and the law prevents helping them, we should prioritize doing the right thing and helping each other over following the law.

* _Attacked predatory money lenders:_ Jesus physically attacked moneylenders (the equivalent to today's bankers and payday loan sharks) in the Temple who exploited his people.

* _Associated with other revolutionaries:_ Christ associated with Zealots, which were a Jewish revolutionary movement. At least one of Jesus's disciples was a Zealot, and perhaps more. Among other things, Zealots were known for not paying taxes and even killing Roman tax collectors.

* _Christ was killed like a revolutionary:_ Crucifixion was a punishment that the Romans used especially for revolutionaries. Christ was nailed to a cross and left to die in a public place to scare others away from revolutionary activities.

In other words, Christ was tortured to death to scare others away from having the spiritual strength to stand for what's right because the Roman government didn't want people to stand for what's right -- they wanted people to obey, and so they tried to scare the public into submission, as all oppressive governments do.

Unfortunately for the Roman authorities, Jesus had been extremely inspirational, and a religion formed that continued to spread his teachings after he died. The revolutionary movement also continued, with a series of Jewish-Roman rebellions occurring between 66 and 135 CE. None were successful.

The religion inspired by Jesus Christ kept spreading, and by the 300s CE, multiple sects existed. Finally, in 380 CE, something weird happened. The same Roman government that had killed Jesus Christ imposed Christianity as a religion on the Roman Empire, requiring people to worship Christ as their spiritual leader. Why?

Instead of allowing this revolutionary Christianity to spread and perhaps inspire more people to become revolutionaries, the Roman emperor embraced it, but he embraced a specific version of Christianity that _trained people for obedience_. The Roman state trained Christian followers to think of themselves as lambs, to think of Jesus as obedient, and to think obedience is good. It trained them for low self-worth, taught the belief that people are inclined to sin, and taught that the world itself is sinful.

In other words, the Roman state spread a religious ideology that _discouraged spiritual strength_ and trained people to _misunderstand their revolutionary spiritual leader Jesus Christ,_ even while requiring people to worship Christ, a man of incredible spiritual strength.

When emperor Theodosius imposed _his_ version of Christianity on the Roman Empire, he said those who did not accept it were "demented and insane" and those who would not obey the new religion "shall be smitten first by divine vengeance and secondly by the retribution of our own initiative." In other words, anyone who disagreed with the official Roman version of Christianity was threatened with severe punishment.

The Roman authorities decided which stories would be included in the Holy Bible which they forced on their empire, and they chose which aspects of that Bible would be emphasized in official teachings. And then they pretended that the Bible was the literal word of God, instead of an ideology imposed on conquered people by their rulers to train them for submissive obedience.

Countless Christians have grown up since then believing that Christ really was obedient, and obedience really is good and ordained by God. Of course, plenty of ruling classes in Europe and around the world have been happy for their conquered people to believe this pro-obedience religious ideology, and they have urged Christian missionaries to spread it, even many centuries after the fall of the Roman Empire.

And tragically, when Christians embrace the pro-obedience Christian ideology instead of really studying Jesus Christ directly, Christians commonly act in ways that Jesus Christ himself would have strongly opposed. Christian missionaries have traveled the world ostensibly to share Jesus' wisdom, but they commonly have spread shame and sexism and they have equated pleasure and sin -- unlike Jesus Christ. For centuries, missionaries have urged people to hoard wealth -- unlike Jesus Christ, who urged his followers to give away their wealth. Wherever obedient Christians have gone, they've spread dictatorships where a few people dictate the laws and the rest submissively obey -- unlike their revolutionary spiritual leader Jesus Christ, who opposed the Roman dictatorship he lived in.

As long as people embrace submissive obedience, this sort of deep confusion will remain.

Muslims recognize Jesus Christ as a prophet, and Christians recognize Christ as the only Son of God. I urge everybody to be more like Jesus Christ, and stop being so obedient. _Be like Jesus Christ, and find the spiritual strength to stand for what's right_ instead of passively tolerating needless suffering and corruption.

Would people believe obedience is so good if they knew what free societies are like where there is no submissive obedience? How is it even possible to live in a way where everyone follows laws, but no one is obedient?

### How Can People Follow Their Nation's Laws Without Obedience?

Every nation has laws, whether the nation is healthy or not. But when the laws work for everyone, there's no need for obedience. In healthy cultures, no one forces laws on anybody else that they don't like. In addition, _everyone is expected to uphold their laws, not obey them._ In this way, they have laws they follow, but no obedience. Everyone is expected to have the same spiritual strength as Jesus Christ to stand for what's right no matter what.

So how can a nation have leaders if people refuse to obey? It's simple: no one obeys their leaders in healthy cultures. They _choose_ the leader whose direction they value, and if that leader begins to disappoint them, they choose a different leader. As Haudenosaunee man Segwalise said, the leaders are "there by the will of the people and when they don't perform, the will of the people will remove them."

Thus people in healthy cultures _choose whom to follow, and only follow as long as they value the leader's direction._ This allows healthy cultures to have strong leaders, but no rulers.

Consider a military setting. In unhealthy cultures, militaries are very strict hierarchies where each soldier is expected to follow orders or be severely punished. Soldiers do not choose which commander or which orders to follow.

Contrast that with a healthy-culture military. Apache man Geronimo said that warriors would assume various positions of leadership by common consent, and would only keep those positions as long as they led well.

That is, each person accepted _personal responsibility_ to choose an excellent leader, and to ensure they were leading well. If a leader disappointed them, they would choose another leader.

In this way, lower-ranked warriors would accept their leader's directions, but they _chose_ to accept his directions because they valued his leadership. It may superficially seem like obedience, but when the warriors knew that the bravest and most selfless warrior among them was their leader, they didn't need to obey because they wanted to follow!

This is normal in healthy-culture militaries: the warriors choose the best leaders and willingly follow them as long as they lead well, but there is zero submissive obedience. This explains why Sioux man Red Cloud said that, before colonization, "We were as free as the winds and like the eagle, heard no man's commands. We fought our enemies and feasted our friends."

When each person accepted personal responsibility to _choose who to follow,_ the Apache wound up selecting incredibly capable military leaders. In fact, healthy culture militaries were formidable opponents for the United States until the late 1800s, which explains why the US army named so much military equipment after them, including the UH-72 Lakota utility helicopter, AH-64 Apache attack helicopter, and C-12 Huron transport aircraft.

This shows that whole nations can live without obedience, where everybody _upholds_ their law but nobody obeys it. When religious authorities train people to think obedience is good, they're only trying to cement their rule and keep people from seeking real justice and freedom.

### Authorities Attack and Kill Our Spiritual Leaders

There is always a tension in unhealthy cultures: which leaders will people follow?

Will people follow the laws of their ruling class leaders and lower authorities, with all their corruption and greed? Or will they follow true servant-leaders, the spiritual leaders who seek justice and stand for what's right, even at great personal risk?

Because oppression is normal in every unhealthy culture, spiritual leaders commonly arise to help people take a stand against it. Countless spiritual leaders like Jesus Christ and Martin Luther King Jr have helped people share resources, trust their neighbors, release their shame, increase their self-worth, recognize false propaganda, understand their true history, protect themselves from predatory law enforcement, and more.

Jesus Christ was called a "messiah" (which simply means "savior" or "liberator") because the Jews wanted someone to save them. But save them from what? For centuries, Christian authorities have trained Christians to misunderstand Jesus Christ, saying he "died for our sins." Jews certainly wanted a savior, but not because they were sinful -- they wanted a revolutionary leader who would save them from oppressive Roman authorities.

Furthermore, Christ did not intentionally die; he chose to do important work even recognizing that it would cost him his life. Jesus clearly loved his people so much that he helped the hungry and sick even when the law forbade him from doing so, and he tried to protect them from predatory moneylenders. The Jews wanted a revolutionary leader, and Jesus stood up and did his revolutionary work even knowing that authorities would surely kill him for it. And they did.

Martin Luther King Jr likewise confronted deep injustices, working to end racial oppression and imperialism in the United States in the 1950s and 1960s. Like Jesus Christ, he carried on his work fully aware that he would be killed for it. And the United States government did indeed kill Martin Luther King Jr, as documented by copious evidence at a trial in Memphis, Tennessee in 1999.

In unhealthy cultures, _authorities consistently attack or kill our greatest spiritual leaders_, the ones who show the most bravery and generosity, who act in deepest service, who work the hardest to end the injustices that always exist when a few people rule over the rest.

Authorities and their police try to maintain order, and what could be more disruptive and threatening of the ruler-based social order than a true servant-leader who helps free their people?

Killing or imprisoning spiritual leaders is a key way that police maintain order. A declassified US FBI memo from the 1960s even explicitly stated their goal: to 'Prevent the RISE OF A "MESSIAH" who could unify, and electrify, the militant black nationalist movement.' The memo even mentioned Martin Luther King Jr as a possible messiah.

Countless people in unhealthy cultures are so removed from the intrinsic strength and moral compass that we all are born with that they truly believe they need authorities' "leadership" and "strength" to keep them safe, unaware that authorities actually attack or kill the wisest, bravest and most generous servant-leaders among us.

This explains how people have been trained to obey corrupt leaders over the centuries. Authorities attack or kill our spiritual leaders, and then spread hurtful ideologies or distorted stories to encourage submissive obedience. Authorities also discourage people from learning what free societies are like, where everybody stands for what's right, leaders actually serve the people and nobody obeys anybody else.

It is critically important to chooes for yourself what to believe. Ancient spiritual leaders have much to teach, but ancient distortions can keep people from understanding their deepest lessons. As long as you accept submissive obedience as necessary and normal, you will endure endless corruption and greed in your society. Only by understanding your own power and choosing for yourself what to believe and what principles to adopt can you help build a healthy culture without these deeply abusive troubles.
