## Chapter 9: Why Do People Obey Corrupt Leaders?

The common experience of living in a nation dominated by a ruling class comes down to this: you must obey their laws whether you like them or not. And even if you like their laws, you must not do anything yourself to enforce those laws when someone else violates them. Responding to bad behavior can only be done by enforcement agents chosen by the ruling class, called the police. If you take action on your own to pursue justice when someone behaves badly, you risk being punished. Whether or not you like the rulers and lower authorities, you must obey.

Obeying corrupt, unaccountable leaders is considered normal in unhealthy nations. People don't choose their bosses at work, don't choose their commanders in the military, and don't really choose their political leaders. In democracies, politicians run and win based primarily on money, and therefore they are effectively chosen by the rich.

_How on Earth do so many people think it is OK to obediently follow the rules of corrupt leaders?_ How did people get to the point where they submissively obey laws they don't agree with and corrupt authorities they don't like, and then accept their own obedience as legitimate and normal?

Nearly all religious and political authorities insist on and promote obedience. To make obedience seem normal and right, they have purposely hidden or distorted important aspects of history by controlling the contents of holy books like the Bible, Torah, and Quran, as well as history books and other teaching materials, and emphasized the aspects that promote obedience.

No example better reveals how this distortion works than the real story of history's most misunderstood spiritual leader: Jesus Christ.

### What Would Jesus Do? We Have Been Purposely Trained Not To Know

For almost 2,000 years, Christian authorities have taught Christian followers to be obedient, and to see Jesus Christ as an example of righteous obedience.

One elder of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints claims, "Jesus Christ, the Only Begotten Son of God, learned perfect obedience."[xxx-latterday jesus obed] A Catholic leader claims, "Christ asks for our obedience in many ways."[xxx-catholic jesus obed] An Evangelical Christian pastor wrote, "Jesus Christ came as the incarnated divine Son to live a human life of perfect obedience and submission."[xxx-tgc jesus obed]

However, the Bible shows that Jesus Christ was anything but obedient. To really understand Jesus, we must understand the times he lived in.

The Romans had conquered Jerusalem and the surrounding region about 60 years before Jesus was born. They imposed heavy taxes, unwanted imperialism, a client king that obeyed Roman authorities, and generally treated the people abusively. Many Jewish revolutionaries worked to free themselves from the Romans, longing for a country where Jews could be safe. Eventually this led to a series of wars between the Romans and the rebellious Jews, starting with the First Jewish Revolt in 66 CE, about 30 years after Jesus' death.[xxx-britannica jewish revolt]

Thus, during Jesus' time, oppressed Jewish people longed for a "messiah," which means "savior" or "liberator."[xxx-oxford messiah] It's easy to understand why. The Jews wanted a revolutionary leader to help save them from oppressive Roman rule.

Jesus Christ saw huge amounts of needless suffering all around. A few people were rich and had far more than they needed, and many suffered needlessly from troubles like hunger, sickness, and poverty.

Instead of merely obeying the law and tolerating these troubles, Christ consistently stood for what's right _even in violation of the law._ He had the spiritual strength to stand for what's right at great personal risk, knowing he would die for serving his people.

Consider how incredibly disobedient Jesus Christ was:

* _Fed people illegally:_ Jesus Christ illegally fed hungry people on the Sabbath. (Mark 2:23-24)[xxx-bible esv|mark 2:23-24]

* _Healed people illegally:_ Christ illegally healed people on the Sabbath. (Matthew 12:10, Mark 3:2)[xxx-bible niv|matthew 12:10]<sup>,</sup>[xxx-bible niv|mark 3:2]

* _Prioritized doing the right thing over following the law:_ When religious and legal authorities reminded him of the law, Christ said that taking care of people was more important than the law, saying, "The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath." (Mark 2:27)[xxx-bible niv|mark 2:27] In other words, when people are in need and the law prevents helping them, we should prioritize doing the right thing and helping each other over following an unjust law. 

* _Attacked predatory money lenders:_ Jesus physically attacked predatory moneylenders (the equivalent to today's bankers and payday loan sharks) in the Temple who exploited his people. (Mark 11:15-18)[xxx-bible esv|mark 11:15-18]

* _Associated with other revolutionaries:_ Christ associated with Zealots, and at least one of his disciples was a Zealot. Zealots were revolutionaries. Among other things, Zealots were known for not paying taxes and even killing Roman tax collectors.[xxx-britannica jewish overview]<sup>,</sup>[xxx-worldhistory jewish zealots]

* _At trial, Jesus was accused of challenging Roman authority:_ At his trial, among other things, Christ was accused of subverting the nation, encouraging illegal tax avoidance, and claiming he was the rightful leader of the Jews.[xxx-bible kjb|luke 23:2] He did not deny the charges.[xxx-bible esv|matthew 27:12]

* _Christ was killed like a revolutionary:_ The two men killed with Christ were not just thieves. They were revolutionaries.[xxx-worldhistory jewish zealots] They were nailed to a cross and publicly left to die. The Romans used crucifixion to scare others away from revolutionary activities.

Christ stood up for his people against oppressive authorities in worldly and spiritual ways, seeking to free them from Roman rule. He was publicly tortured to death to scare others away from having the spiritual strength to stand for what's right because the Roman government didn't want people to stand for what's right -- they wanted people to obey, and so they tried to scare the public into submission.

Some Christians claim that Christ was obedient because he said, "Give back to Caesar what is Caesar's," suggesting people should pay their taxes.[xxx-bible niv|mark 12:17] But revolutionaries commonly debate whether to pay taxes. Should you pay taxes to avoid government harassment, so you can focus on liberating your people? Or do you choose not to pay taxes to a corrupt government and face the consequences? Christ clearly was one of these revolutionaries who chose to pay taxes while seeking to liberate his people. 

Unfortunately for the Roman authorities, Jesus was extremely inspirational, and a religion formed that continued to spread his teachings after he died. The revolutionary movement also continued, with a series of Jewish-Roman rebellions occurring between 66 and 135 CE. None were successful.[xxx-britannica jewish overview]

The religion inspired by Jesus Christ kept spreading, and by the 300s CE, multiple sects existed. Finally, in 380 CE, something strange happened. The same Roman government that had killed Jesus Christ imposed Christianity as a religion on the Roman Empire, requiring people to worship Jesus Christ as their spiritual leader. Why?[xxx-codex theodosianus xvi 1.2. the theodosian code|p440]

Instead of allowing revolutionary forms of Christianity to spread and inspire more people to become revolutionaries like Christ, the Roman emperor embraced it, but he embraced a specific version of Christianity _that trained people for obedience._ The Roman state trained Christian followers to think of themselves as lambs, to think of Jesus as obedient, and to think obedience is good.

When Roman emperor Theodosius imposed _his_ version of Christianity on the Roman Empire, he said those who did not accept it were "demented and insane" and those who would not obey the new religion "shall be smitten first by divine vengeance and secondly by the retribution of our own initiative." Anyone who disagreed with the official Roman version of Christianity was threatened with severe punishment.[xxx-codex theodosianus xvi 1.2. the theodosian code|p440]

In many ways, the Roman state spread a religious ideology that _discouraged the spiritual strength_ needed to stand up for what's right. Thus Christians were trained to _misunderstand their revolutionary spiritual leader Jesus Christ,_ even while authorities required them to worship Christ, a man of incredible spiritual strength.

As a result, Christians have endlessly debated when to obey, how to obey, or whom to obey. But _the attitude of obedience itself is rarely questioned,_ which is why every Christian society in history has had oppressive authorities that Christians have obeyed. And whenever Christians have had a revolution, they merely put different oppressive authorities in charge that likewise expect obedience.

So how exactly did Roman emperor Theodosius impose a version of Christianity that discouraged spiritual strength and encouraged obedience instead? It turns out that ruling classes around the world want to train people to obey corrupt authorities, and they commonly use similar tricks.

To understand these tricks, I invite you to step into the shoes of a ruler and ask, "if I were a ruler, how would I train people for obedience?"

### Ancient and Modern Religious Training to Maintain Submissive Obedience

If you were a king, and you wanted to train your subjects to obey you, what would you do? For starters, you would want to train your subjects to not stand for justice, and instead to passively accept your laws and how you choose to enforce them (or not).

And what would be a highly effective way of accomplishing that? How about imposing a religion that trained your subjects to believe that obeying authorities was good and morally right, and disobeying was evil and bad? 

Every religion has aspects of wisdom and beauty. However, when ruling classes impose an ideology or religion, they consistently twist or distort this ancient wisdom and beauty so that people learn to submit to authorities instead of personally standing for what's right. Unfortunately, this is essentially how religions like Christianity, Islam, and Buddhism train people for submissive obedience.

Roman emperor Theodosius imposed _his_ version of Christianity on ancient Rome, and he threatened severe punishment to anyone who didn't convert.[xxx-codex theodosianus xvi 1.2. the theodosian code|p440] And what does the official Christian Bible say? According to 1-Peter 2:13: "Submit yourselves for the Lord's sake to every human authority: whether to the emperor, as the supreme authority, or to governors..."[xxx-bible niv|1 peter 2:13]

Islamic rulers have also propagated this same pro-obedience ideology in their religion. The Quran says, "O believers! Obey Allah and obey the Messenger and those in authority among you."[xxx-quran|4:59] Other authoritarian religions also train people to believe that God says to obey their rulers.

The trouble runs deeper though. In abusive relationships, the abuser will often try to control the victim by lowering the victim's self-esteem in various ways -- by making them doubt themselves and doubt their own senses, by shaming and belittling them, by training the victim to think they're lucky to live with the abuser and would be worse off on their own. Victims may be told that abuse is normal in relationships, or victims deserve what they get. Not surprisingly, victims who believe these things are more likely to tolerate abuse and stay in abusive relationships instead of leaving them.

Unhealthy nations all have a ruling class that exploits the rest, so all unhealthy nations create and maintain massive, multi-generational abusive relationships. The rulers are the ultimate oppressive abusers, with many lower authorities in religion, business, and politics also abusing or exploiting others. 

In unhealthy nations -- just like in abusive domestic relationships between two people -- abusive authorities commonly impose ideologies that encourage things like shame, low self-worth, disconnection from divinity, fear of one's core instincts, rejection of pleasure, sexism, beliefs that humans are inherently selfish and untrustworthy, and beliefs that people deserve to suffer.

Self-respecting people do not passively submit to abusive authorities, but when people deeply embrace these hurtful attitudes or beliefs, they can become more willing to accept abuse, isolation, dissatisfaction, apathy, meaninglessness, superficiality, or despair.

For example, the Catholic Church's official dogma states that humans are "inclined to sin" and have "an inclination to evil." Still one of the most followed religions in the world, Catholicism states that the first human (Adam) "lost the original holiness and justice he had received from God, not only for himself but for all human beings."[xxx-catholic catechism|405]<sup>,</sup>[xxx-catholic catechism|416-418]

And it's not just humans who are inherently bad or evil. Catholic dogma states that human sin "put the world as a whole in the sinful condition."[xxx-catholic catechism|408]

This message that humans are born without holiness, inclined to evil, and disconnected from divinity is deeply shameful and discouraging. And it gets worse -- apparently we were born into a sinful world that our sinful ways helped create! What message could possibly encourage more hopelessness?[xxx-catholic catechism|416-418]<sup>,</sup>[xxx-catholic catechism|408]

The Islamic Quran likewise causes people to doubt their own sense of right and wrong, and to trust authorities instead. The Quran repeatedly states Allah's omniscience: "Surely Allah is Almighty, All-Wise[xxx-quran|2:220]... And Allah is All-Hearing, All-Knowing."[xxx-quran|2:224] The Quran paints the Islamic God Allah as omniscient, and how should a person respond if they have a feeling, urge, or thought that does not align with their authorities' religious text? The Quran is clear: "Perhaps you dislike something which is good for you and like something which is bad for you. Allah knows and you do not know."[xxx-quran|2:216]

Buddhist authorities have pulled the same authority-supporting tricks. Visitors to Tibet prior to the Chinese takeover in the 1950s found Tibetan Buddhists teaching that the world is full of evil. Every bend of the road, stream crossing, or village entrance had to have a row of flags to exorcize evil spirits. Lakes, wells, and streams teamed with demons who brought floods and hail storms upon anyone who violated their religious leaders' rules.[xxx-lhasa vol 1|p350]

Evil could exist almost anywhere, from doorways to cracks in stones, and -- surprise, surprise -- only the priests could protect people from evil, for a fee of course. This ideology scared people away from the wilderness, seeing nonhumans as evil spirits rather than teachers and siblings offering their gifts. This further trained people to live in fear and kept them in poverty.[xxx-lhasa vol 1|p350]

Even the Tibetan Buddhist belief in karma has been used to excuse extreme exploitation by rich monks and lamas. The fourteenth dalai lama implied that serfs clearly deserve their suffering when he said, "A poor Tibetan was less inclined to envy or resent his Tibetan landlord because he knew that each of them was reaping the seed he had sown in his previous life."[xxx-timely rain|p127]

Why would rulers deliberately push these attitudes and beliefs? Do you think it's a coincidence that these attitudes and beliefs discourage the spiritual strength and collective solidarity that might allow people to free themselves by uniting, making their own respectful laws, and upholding those laws together?

This may seem like a stretch, but it is no coincidence that rulers train people for submissive obedience. Sadly there is even more evidence to back this up.

Authoritarian religions also tend to discourage deep sensual pleasure, and Buddhism offers a clear example. The Buddha laid out the Four Noble Truths. Of these, the second is the Noble Truth of the Cause of Suffering, which is "craving that causes rebirth and is bound up with pleasure and lust and finds delight now here, now there. That is, the craving for sensual pleasures." The third is the "Noble Truth of the Cessation of Suffering" which "is the complete fading away and destruction of this very craving... the liberation from it, leaving no place for it." Thus Buddhism equates desire with suffering, and especially the desire for sensual pleasures. Renouncing one's desire for sensual pleasures is supposedly the path to ending suffering.[xxx-vridhamma first discourse]

Of course, conquered people who feel afraid, nervous, dissatisfied, or miserable are not likely to feel deep pleasure. Foregoing pleasure trains people to accept ongoing dissatisfaction as legitimate and normal.

Deep pleasure is so integral to deep life satisfaction that many healthy nations have encouraged sexual pleasure outside the nuclear family, promoting solidarity and deep friendships. For example, some healthy nations such as the Kulina have special events where men and women can have sex with anyone they want except their spouse, promoting deep connections within and across communities. When sexual pleasure is discouraged, this way of building deep relationships and solidarity is also discouraged.[xxx-odoc|ch25]

Religious authorities often put spiritual leaders on a pedestal, as if their spiritual strength was unique or an unattainable ideal. For example, Jesus Christ is often treated as if his grace and spiritual strength was unattainable by mere mortals, and while people should try to learn from him, it's ok and understandable that most people fall far short. This attitude of putting spiritual leaders on a pedestal prevents people from realizing that Jesus Christ's spiritual strength could be normal in a society, and that we should all hold ourselves to that high standard and help each other reach it.[xxx-from deep woods to civilization|civ preached practiced]

Religion is a major way that rulers have imposed sexism. Authoritarian religions commonly discourage solidarity between men and women by training men to see themselves as superior and training women to submit. The Islamic Quran notes that "Men are the caretakers of women, as men have been provisioned by Allah over women... And righteous women are devoutly obedient..."[xxx-quran|4:34] The Christian Bible says, "I [God] would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman is the man."[xxx-bible kjb|1 corinthians 11:3] Tibetan Buddhist authorities, prior to the 1951 Chinese takeover, stated that working women were bad luck, and "among ten women you'll find nine devils."[xxx-when serfs stood up|p329]

If these holy books really are the Word of an All-Powerful God, then who could argue with them? But what if these religions and "holy" books are simply ideologies imposed on conquered people over many centuries, directly and indirectly training them for obedience?

Tragically, even many non-religious ideologies encourage hurtful attitudes. For example, in my economics class in college, I was taught that humans are basically selfish, and this is good because the "invisible hand of the market" will organize people and channel their selfishness into productive activities that are good for capitalist society.

Authoritarian ideologies train people to doubt their instincts, or see obedience as good, or believe they're disconnected from God, evil, shameful, inherently selfish or bad, or only conditionally good (if they obey authority figures). The list of hurtful beliefs is long!

And if people really are so terrible, then of course it's foolish to trust one's neighbors. Thus these beliefs discourage trust too.

Of course, once people have decided to submit, and forgotten what real freedom is like, rulers historically have tricked them into thinking they're free. That's why the USA calls itself "the land of the free and home of the brave,"[xxx-britannica usa anthem] and Christianity and Islam urge Christians and Muslims around the world to believe they are free even while obeying their authorities.[xxx-bible niv|1 peter 2:16]<sup>,</sup>[xxx-islam freedom] Focusing on economic "freedom" instead, the Soviet Union's government claimed it was fostering a revolutionary workers' paradise.[xxx-ussr worker paradise] And yet these are all merely different dictatorships, where a few people dictate the law and everyone else is expected to obey it.

And what are the results of these hurtful religions and ideologies? Unhealthy nations around the world seem "just how life is" to their inhabitants, including Americans, Iraqis, Koreans, and others.

People learn to accept their obedience as normal. When people demand more jobs, lower taxes, less police brutality, or more funding for schools or hospitals, they're essentially demanding that their authorities please rule them better or more efficiently, and please oppress us a little less. Instead of accepting that they are not free and considering what to do about it, people may believe that they are "losing their rights" or "becoming less free" when their ruling class decides to restrict what speech or actions are allowed.

In unhealthy nations, people only have a single political problem: they are not free. Citizens who ignore this root problem may do all sorts of things that can never lead to deep change, such as voting, having unproductive political arguments with neighbors, worrying about life after death, praying by thinking thoughts in their head, or waiting for a prophet to be reborn and save them. People may do almost anything besides the one thing that could actually improve their spiritual, emotional, and physical lives immensely: _come together in solidarity, create their own laws, and uphold them to create new healthy nations._ This is the path to freedom.

I grew up as a Christian, believing in Jesus and God, and it was difficult for me to accept the perspectives in this chapter. But remember that there is wisdom in every nation and religion. You can keep the wisdom you've found by studying Jesus Christ, Buddha, or Mohammad, and you are free to leave the hurtful or unhelpful aspects of these religions behind.

Many authorities insist that their religion or ideology is "all or nothing" -- you either believe everything, or you're cast out as an unbeliever. But that is just bullying, pressuring people to adopt hurtful beliefs or attitudes just to stay in good standing in their community. Each of us has the power and the responsibility to choose which perspectives to embrace and which ones to let go.

### Obedient People Act Contrary to Christ's Teachings

There is a common saying that "the winners write the history books." The Roman authorities killed Jesus Christ, and then centuries later they decided which stories would be included in the Holy Bible which they forced on their empire, and they chose which aspects of that Bible would be emphasized in official teachings. And then they pretended that the Bible was the literal word of God, instead of an ideology imposed on conquered people by their rulers to train them for submissive obedience.

Many Christians have grown up since then believing that Christ really was obedient, and obedience really is good and ordained by God. Ruling classes in Europe and around the world have been happy for their conquered people to believe this pro-obedience religious ideology, and they have urged Christian missionaries to spread it, even many centuries after the fall of the Roman Empire.

And tragically, when Christians embrace the pro-obedience Christian ideology instead of really studying Jesus Christ directly, Christians commonly act in ways that Jesus Christ himself would have strongly opposed. Christian missionaries have traveled the world ostensibly to share Jesus' wisdom, but they have urged people to amass wealth and embrace submissive obedience -- unlike Jesus Christ, who gave away his things and disobediently stood for justice even at personal risk. They have spread the beliefs that people are inherently sinful, and men have a rightful place over women -- unlike Jesus Christ who never taught these things. Wherever obedient Christians have gone, they've spread dictatorships where a few people dictate the laws and the rest submissively obey -- unlike their revolutionary spiritual leader Jesus Christ, who opposed the Roman dictatorship he lived in.

As long as people embrace submissive obedience, this sort of deep confusion will remain.

Muslims recognize Jesus Christ as a prophet, and Christians recognize Christ as the only Son of God. I urge everyone to be more like Jesus Christ, and stop being so obedient. _Be like Jesus Christ, and cultivate the spiritual strength to stand for what's right_ instead of passively tolerating needless suffering and corruption.

Christians, Muslims, and others endlessly debate when it's appropriate to be obedient, and how authorities can use their power "properly." But healthy nations show the truth: to have a way of life with no corruption, no greed, and no discrimination, where respect is normal, there should be _no unaccountable authorities_ and _no submissive obedience._

This is the root truth behind the _golden rule,_ that ancient wisdom which authorities do their best to obscure. Jesus Christ said, "Do to others as you would have them do to you."[xxx-bible niv|luke 6:31] Buddhist scripture says, "Hurt not others with what pains yourself."[xxx-udanavarga|p252] A core Islamic Hadith (guidance) says "None of you will believe until you love for your brother what you love for yourself."[xxx-13th hadith]

When everyone stands for what's right, and everyone expects everyone else in their society to do the same, then the golden rule will be fully realized: each person will treat everyone else as they would want to be treated. The golden rule simply describes the normal way of life in healthy nations.

Fewer people would believe submissive obedience is necessary if they knew what free societies are like where people live without it. Following are some examples showing how whole nations live without _any_ submissive obedience.

### How Can People Follow Their Nation's Laws Without Submissive Obedience?

Every nation has laws, whether the nation is healthy or not. But when the laws work for everyone, there's no need for submissive obedience.

In healthy nations, no one forces laws on anybody else that they don't like. _Everyone is expected to uphold their laws, not obey them._ In this way, they have laws they follow, but no obedience. Each person is expected to have the same spiritual strength as Jesus Christ to stand for what's right no matter what.

"Obeying a leader" happens when people do not like the laws or orders they're given, or don't like how the laws are unjustly enforced, but they do what they're told because they would be punished otherwise.

"Following a leader" happens when people like the leader's directions. There is no threat involved. For example, the crowds of people who listened to Jesus _followed_ his spiritual leadership without any pressure or coercion because they valued his teachings and service, but they were forced to _obey_ Roman authorities whose leadership they didn't like, because they were threatened with punishment for disobeying.

So how can a nation have leadership if no one obeys? It's simple: they _choose_ the leader whose direction they value, and if that leader begins to disappoint them, they choose a different one. As Haudenosaunee man Segwalise said, the leaders are "there by the will of the people and when they don't perform, the will of the people will remove them."[xxx-original instructions|a democracy based on peace]

Thus people in healthy nations _choose whom to follow, and only follow as long as they value the leader's direction._ This allows them to have strong leaders, but no rulers.

Consider a military setting. In unhealthy nations, each soldier is expected to follow orders of commanders who are not accountable to the soldier, or be severely punished. Soldiers do not choose which commander or which orders to follow.

In comparison, Apache man Geronimo said that warriors would assume various positions of leadership by common consent, and would only keep those positions as long as they led well.[xxx-geronimo autobio|preparation of a warrior]

That is, each individual accepted _personal responsibility_ to help choose excellent leaders. If a leader disappointed them, they would choose someone else.

In this way, lower-ranked warriors would accept their leader's directions, but they _chose_ to accept his directions because they valued his leadership. "Choosing to follow" a leader and "being forced to obey" may superficially look similar to outsiders. But when the warriors knew that the bravest and most selfless warrior among them was their leader, they didn't need to be threatened with punishment because they wanted to follow.

This is normal in healthy-nation militaries: the warriors choose the best leaders and willingly follow them as long as they lead well, but there is zero submissive obedience. This explains why Sioux man Red Cloud said that, before colonization, "We were as free as the winds and like the eagle, heard no man's commands. We fought our enemies and feasted our friends."[xxx-black elk life of an american visionary|black robe days]

Major Ana Maria described the hierarchy in the Zapatista military, and how she needed permission to have sexual partners or get married. The military had strict rules to ensure they maintained cohesion and safety as they prepared and carried out their revolution. And yet, because they chose the best servant-leaders and avoided corruption, even this strict hierarchy and its rules were in service of the greater good, and Ana Maria willingly agreed.[xxx-ezln ramona san crist]

Because each person accepts personal responsibility to _choose who to follow,_ healthy nations select incredibly capable military leaders. Healthy-nation militaries were formidable opponents for the United States until the late 1800s, which explains why the US army named so much military equipment after them, including the UH-72 Lakota utility helicopter, AH-64 Apache attack helicopter, and C-12 Huron transport aircraft.[xxx-medium weapon names]

Even children are not raised to submissively obey their parents in healthy nations. People of healthy nations commonly describe life as a spiraling path, where the process of growing from child to elder is the process of taking ever-greater responsibility for oneself and others, continually ensuring the community takes people's and the nonhumans' needs into account.[xxx-grandmothers light|p9]<sup>,</sup>[xxx-braiding sweetgrass|a mothers work]

This explains why young people of healthy nations are often very resilient and capable: instead of blindly obeying authority figures and tolerating meaningless or boring schoolwork, they're raised to take responsibility for themselves and others and they're only given meaningful work. Children raised this way are ready for challenges at each stage of life that surprise people in unhealthy nations.[xxx-continuum concept|growing up]

When Jean Liedloff visited the Yequana, she wrote, "I found the complete absence of pressure by persuasion, by the imposition of one individual's will upon another, difficult to believe or understand, despite the Yequana's perseverance in showing me examples of it." Five Yequana men and a 10 year old boy once joined her and other visitors on an expedition far from their village. After a disagreement, the men chose to leave and one called to Anchu, saying, "Come along!" The boy decided to stay with the foreigners far from home, so he responded, "no." The adults just turned and left.[xxx-continuum concept|growing up]

Liedloff wrote, "There was no attempt to force or even to persuade him to come with them." Young Anchu didn't return home to his village for months, but he was always up for adventure, and "never anything but helpful and always happy." When children are raised to take deep responsibility for themselves and others instead of being raised for submissive obedience, they learn their limits, how to take appropriate risks, how to hold good boundaries and honor others' boundaries, and become self-reliant.[xxx-continuum concept|growing up]

Solidarity is a core value in every healthy nation. So what happens when people disagree on something important, such as where to live or whether to fight a war? Don't they still need to choose a leader, and isn't that leader going to make a decision that many of them don't like, and just have to live with?

Actually, no. In healthy nations, when there is a big dispute, communities may split into smaller groups so that each group has full unity. Because they can split up as needed, often there aren't hard feelings and the new smaller communities may remain friends and help each other in emergencies.

For example, Pretty Shield described how her Crow community had a quarrel in about 1832 and divided into two groups, the Mountain Crows and River Crows. Pretty Shield was born a Mountain Crow but went to live with an aunt who was a River Crow. She said, "This separation from my mother and my sisters was in fact not a very real one, because all the Crows came together often." The Crows never considered living unhappily together and letting the majority impose a way of life that the minority resented. After separating, each group had a way of life and leadership that was satisfactory to all, and the groups remained friendly.[xxx-red mother|p21]

Other stories from the Nez Perce[xxx-indian heroes and great chieftains|chief joseph] and Sioux[xxx-indian child life|faithfulness long ears] show that this willingness to split into separate groups while remaining friendly is a common traditional way of respectfully handling major disputes.

When people in gift economies don't worry about private property and land ownership, they have a lot of flexibility when solving disputes. When people in profit economies feel the need to protect themselves and their property from untrustworthy neighbors, it becomes much harder to resolve disputes respectfully.

These stories show that whole nations can live without submissive obedience, where everybody upholds their law but nobody obeys it. When religious authorities train people to think submissive obedience is good and necessary, they're only trying to cement their rule and keep people from seeking real justice and freedom.

### Authorities Attack or Kill Our Spiritual Leaders

There is always a tension in unhealthy nations: which leaders will people follow?

Will people follow the laws of their ruling class leaders and lower authorities, with all their corruption and greed? Or will they follow true servant-leaders, the spiritual leaders who seek justice and stand for what's right, even at great personal risk?

Because oppression is normal in every unhealthy nation, spiritual leaders commonly arise to help people take a stand against it. Many spiritual leaders like Jesus Christ and Martin Luther King Jr have helped people in a variety of ways, including sharing resources, trusting their neighbors, releasing shame and increasing self-worth, recognizing false propaganda, and protecting themselves from predatory law enforcement.

Jesus Christ was called a "messiah" or "savior" because the Jews wanted someone to save them. But save them from what? For centuries, Christian authorities have trained Christians to misunderstand Jesus Christ, saying he "died for our sins."[xxx-jesus died for sins] Jews certainly wanted a savior, but not because they were sinful -- they wanted a revolutionary leader who would save them from oppressive Roman authorities.

Furthermore, Christ did not intentionally die; he chose to do important work knowing that it would cost him his life. He clearly loved his people so much that he helped the hungry[xxx-bible esv|mark 2:23-24] and sick[xxx-bible niv|mark 3:2] even when it was illegal, and he tried to protect them from predatory moneylenders.[xxx-bible esv|mark 11:15-18] The Jews wanted a revolutionary leader, and Jesus stood up and did his revolutionary work knowing that authorities would surely kill him for it.[xxx-bible niv|mark 10:32-34] And they did.

Martin Luther King Jr likewise confronted deep injustices, working to end racial oppression and imperialism in the United States in the 1950s and 1960s.[xxx-georgiaencyclopedia king] Like Jesus Christ, he carried on his work fully aware that he would be killed for it.[xxx-mlk final speech afscmd] And the United States government did indeed kill Martin Luther King Jr, as extensively documented at a trial in Memphis, Tennessee in 1999.[xxx-ratical king memphis trial]

In unhealthy nations, _authorities consistently attack or kill our greatest spiritual leaders,_ the ones who show the most bravery and generosity, who act in deepest service, who work the hardest to end the injustices that always exist when a few people rule over the rest.

Authorities and their police try to maintain order, and what could be more disruptive and threatening of the ruler-based social order than a true servant-leader who helps free their people?

Killing or imprisoning spiritual leaders is a key way that police maintain order. A declassified US FBI memo from the 1960s stated their goal: to 'Prevent the RISE OF A "MESSIAH" who could unify, and electrify, the militant black nationalist movement.' The memo named Martin Luther King Jr as a possible messiah.[xxx-fbi messiah]

Every person is born with intrinsic strength and a moral compass, but many people in unhealthy nations still believe they need authorities' "leadership" and "strength" to keep them safe, unaware that authorities actually attack or kill the wisest, bravest and most generous servant-leaders among us.

This explains how people have been trained to obey corrupt leaders over the centuries. Authorities attack or kill our spiritual leaders and then spread hurtful ideologies or distorted stories to encourage submissive obedience. Authorities also discourage people from learning what free societies are like, where everybody stands for what's right, nobody obeys corrupt leaders, and justice is normal.

It is critically important to choose for yourself what to believe. Ancient spiritual leaders have much to teach, but ancient distortions can keep you from understanding their deepest lessons. As long as you accept submissive obedience as necessary and normal, you will endure endless corruption and greed in your society.

Only by tapping into your own power to choose what to believe and what principles to uphold can you help build a healthy nation without these deep troubles.
