## Chapter 11: Can Whole Nations Embrace Awareness and Unity?

When I first began doing nature connection practices, I thought I would just connect with nonhumans. It turns out they helped me connect more deeply with people too. If a whole group of people regularly embraced these practices, they could feel closely connected indeed. There would be no place for sexism, racism and hatred.

Every day, I go to my sit-spot and pay attention to the nonhumans. I ask questions like, what plants grow at what times of the year? What birds live there, and how do they interact with each other and the plants? What animals live there or pass through? I learned to pay attention with all my senses. I learned to feel curious about the experiences of the beings around me, and I supplemented my observations with research -- both by reading nature guide books and listening to stories from mentors.

Sitting there each day, I wondered, for example, why a bird would constantly look up as they eat. I learned that they stay continuously aware in case predators arrive. I also saw that some species of tree grew near each other, while others did not. Black walnuts, for example, produce a compound which only some plants find toxic, so they grow near sugar maple and box elder but white pines avoid them.

I continually practiced feeling into the experiences of other living beings based on my observations. I imagined being a songbird and how terrifying it would be to have a sharp-shinned hawk swoop out of the sky and snatch me up in an instant. If I were a songbird, I would probably eat carefully too!

Eventually I learned something really cool: plants and animals can help me notice parts of the landscape I can't observe directly. The movement of a bird might indicate a hidden possum moving through low brush. Or, some birds and other animals like deer can see ultraviolet light that is invisible to humans. Many people's clothes reflect ultraviolet light. I might not notice a person hiding in the woods, but birds can see the ultraviolet light reflected off the clothes. If I notice birds responding to it, I can learn about the hidden person's presence with the birds' help.

The first of the three core spiritual practices -- cultivating a practical, aware gratitude -- helped me become much more aware of my environment, and grateful for all the life in it.

Over time, I learned to observe more closely, question my assumptions, and empathize with nonhumans, and the same attitudes and skills helped me understand and empathize with other people too. Even people who are not like me.

For example, growing up, I learned that women can get extra sensitive during their period. For years I learned to leave women alone during this time. But as with my nature connection practices, I started asking, "how is this a gift?" or "what does this have to teach me?"

I noticed that some women friends would reject food during their period that they normally ate, and when I asked, they said the food was rancid. I would try it and I couldn't taste any rancidity at first. As I learned to taste my food more and more, I began to notice the occasional rancidity, especially in store-bought food. I realized that the sensitive women had noticed something I couldn't notice. Like the birds, women could show me something about my environment that I could not experience directly. When a woman said some food was rancid, I trusted her even if I couldn't detect it, and I rejected the food too.

And here is the best part: Over time this helped me notice rancidity I couldn't notice before. In other words, listening to others and trusting them helped me grow in ways I could not have grown on my own.

The more I cultivated careful awareness, the more deeply I could see. For example, I'm a white man, and when I hear black Americans repeatedly complain about police brutality, it shows me where my society isn't as fair as it seems in my experience.

When children complain about being forced to sit through boring or meaningless classes at school, they show me that people weren't born to tolerate boredom and meaningless work in adulthood -- we have to be trained for it.

As I became more empathetic and observant, I started treating everyone around me like an extension of me, whether men or women or children or nonhumans. Their awareness became an extension of my awareness. I paid attention to what other people observed or how they behaved and let it show me things I couldn't see by myself. I don't blindly trust everyone, but I take care to notice what lessons I can learn from others.

Ultimately, I can only know my own experience, but this doesn't have to limit me when I cultivate deep awareness. With enough practice asking questions and paying attention, I can see others' perspectives even if their experiences are really different from mine. I might not always agree with someone else's point of view, but I can at least understand their perspective which helps me understand their behavior. And when I get it wrong, that just becomes another chance to grow my observation skills and learn.

These nature connection practices are key to generating unity among people and nonhumans in any nation. Once I started really noticing the perspectives of insects, bears and plants, it became easier to notice and understand other people's perspectives.

When everybody embraces these deep awareness practices, mutual understanding and empathy become common, helping any group find and maintain deep unity -- even in unhealthy nations.

These practices also help people make fewer foolish assumptions. Assumptions are simply unexamined beliefs. When you continuously pay attention to what you observe, you notice what you know and what you don't know. There's little room for unexamined beliefs.

But this is not the only way that cultivating a practical, aware gratitude can help people maintain unity.

### Generating Unity by Giving Thanks Together

The Haudenosaunee show the kind of unity that comes from these nature connection practices. They have a very special Thanksgiving Address where they methodically go through different forms of life and give thanks to each. They thank the medicine herbs for removing sickness and the fish for purifying water. They give thanks to the trees for providing shelter and food. They give thanks to all the divine beings who give so much to create the web of life that we're all part of.

The Haudenosaunee open every gathering with the Thanksgiving Address, calling it the Words Before All Else. While each rendition is unique, the version I learned ends in this way:

_Now we have arrived in a very special place where dwells the Great Spirit that moves through all things. As one mind we turn our thoughts to the Creator with Thanksgiving and Greetings._[xxx-kamana 2 nat|p1]

_We have now become like one being, with one body, one heart, one mind. We send our Prayers and special Thanksgiving Greetings to all the unborn Children of all the Future Generations. We send our thoughts to the many different Beings we may have missed during our Thanksgiving. With one mind we send our Thanksgiving and Greetings to all of the Nations of the World._[xxx-kamana 2 nat|p1]

_Now our minds are one._[xxx-kamana 2 nat|p1]

Healthy nations generate unity in many ways. In this example, I believe the Haudenosaunee become a people of one mind and one heart by collectively recognizing divinity in all things, recognizing their sacred place in divinity, and giving thanks together.

This Thanksgiving Address helps me remember to feel gratitude and feel connected with life. It softens my heart, and it does much more too. It shows how a nation's leaders can encourage unity and awareness rather than division and ignorance.

When I began giving thanks to the nonhumans for their divine gifts, I realized that God is not off in the sky; Creator is alive in Creation. I believe that's what it means to recognize the Great Spirit That Moves Through All Beings, a perspective I've found in many healthy nations. In Christianity, this is called the Holy Spirit. And since Creator is alive in Creation, when people stand in solidarity with the Earth, they're standing in solidarity with Creator.

Being in solidarity with life means being in solidarity with God. Being One with the Earth and being One with God are the same thing. The same three core spiritual practices that generate solidarity among people in healthy nations also generate solidarity between people and all life, and with divinity itself.

Racism and other kinds of discrimination do not have to exist. Whole nations are capable of incredible unity when they base their way of life on the three core spiritual practices.

<div class="rev-act-body">No matter how much or little you know, the same basic practices can help you cultivate awareness and connection with the living world. Find a place within 15 minutes of your house where you can observe the wildlife -- a place you like to be. Go there every day, practice feeling gratitude for the nonhumans' gifts, and observe what's going on.<br/><br/>What trails do you see? What birds live there, and what are their lives like? Consider what desires and fears each animal or plant has, what relationships they have with each other, and what lessons they have to teach. _I strongly recommend looking for a nature connection mentor or program to help you on your path._</div></div>

<div class="rev-act-body">When hurtful and false rumors spread about someone, they can feel very insecure. People want to be seen for who they are, and people want to trust that their friends will actively verify important facts instead of assuming that hurtful, false rumors are true. Next time you hear a hurtful rumor about somebody, cultivate awareness and avoid assumptions by verifying the truth for yourself.</div></div>
