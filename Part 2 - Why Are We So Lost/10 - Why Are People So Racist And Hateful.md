## Chapter 10: Why Are People So Racist And Hateful?

Many people born and raised in unhealthy cultures seem to think that humans are naturally prone to be racist, sexist, and even hateful. Or at least some are.

This is not true. No one is born racist, sexist, or hateful. Every child, regardless of their culture, is born with an open heart, full of curiosity and empathy for others.

However, immersed in unhealthy cultures from birth, many babies eventually become confused children who grow up to be racist, sexist, or hateful adults. By then, it all seems quite natural and normal. People are culturally programmed to discriminate against others. That programming is not inherent in our DNA. It has to be taught.

How are racism and other kinds of discrimination taught? I believe this relentless training arises from three underlying cultural drivers:

1. _Systemic discrimination_: Rulers and lower authorities artificially impose differences between races by purposely treating different groups of people in different ways in terms of the law, pay, exposure to toxic pollution, how they are commonly represented in news and entertainment, access to food, school funding, and many other conditions. Authorities may also propagate hateful or racist beliefs and then punish anyone who disagrees. 

    For example, in the 1600s, wealthy slaveowners in colonial Virginia decided only black people would be chattel slaves, whereas poor whites could be overseers, shopkeepers, farmers, and soldiers. Poor white people were thus strongly encouraged to support chattel slavery, siding with rich slave owners against the chattel slaves. Anyone who spoke out against this system risked being attacked, imprisoned or killed, including white people, which led to a strong anti-black racism among Virginian white people.

2. _Adopting an authoritarian attitude_: Many people learn to adopt racist attitudes that are imposed or encouraged by authorities in order to maintain or advance their own privilege, comfort, and safety in their abusive unhealthy culture. Continuing the above example, white people in colonial Virginia were more likely to support chattel slavery than work together to confront the rich slave owners who kept them all in poverty. We see this in many forms today, as many people adopt attitudes and beliefs that help protect their privilege.

3. _Child abuse_: Some kinds of child abuse predispose people to embrace authoritarian attitudes. For example, studies show that children who are physically abused are more likely to perpetuate, or at least tolerate, abuse of themselves or others. Since abusive exploitation is common in unhealthy cultures, many abused parents tragically abuse their children or cannot offer loving affection and healthy boundaries, training children to develop hurtful traits.

How does this work in practice?

A well-known children's story illustrates how authorities impose and maintain racism and hatred, not just in the past, but similar to major events happening in the news today.

### Authorities Impose and Maintain Racism and Hatred by Insisting We All Go Along With It

Remember that old story "The Emperor's New Clothes"?

A con man tricks an emperor into believing that he is dressed in beautiful, expensive clothing when, in fact, he is wearing nothing at all. Afraid to be called a fool by this very confident man, the emperor pretends that he really is wearing beautiful clothing, and his close officials go along with it. The emperor then goes out among the public stark naked, and the masses of people pretend to admire his fine clothing. Everybody maintains this pretense until a child blurts out that the emperor is nude.

When I first found this story as a child, it seemed silly! Why would all the adults pretend to believe an obvious falsehood? But I have a question for you -- do you think you would point out the king's nakedness? Or would you pretend too?

So what does this old children's story have to teach about ignorance, racism, and hatred happening right now?

In this story, the emperor is the ruler, meaning he decides on the laws and how they're enforced, and he can punish people who express beliefs that he doesn't like. The people in this story know that, and they know, consciously or not, that it is safer to go along and believe that he is beautifully dressed, or at least pretend to believe, rather than face the truth. After all, acknowledging the truth could lead to imprisonment or worse.

And over time, this becomes a habit that feels more or less normal for many people living since birth in unhealthy cultures.

### In Unhealthy Cultures, Unaccountable Authorities Punish Those Who Speak Up

Let's look at some historical examples to see how this works.

In the US pre-Civil War south, chattel slavery was assumed to be good for the slaves by all right-thinking people. Doctors even had a diagnosis called "Draepetomania" where any slave who tried to escape was believed to have a mental illness! Why would they believe such nonsense, even highly trained doctors, instead of simply recognizing the evils of slavery and acknowledging people's healthy desire to escape?

The answer is simple: any white Americans who sympathized with black people and acknowledged the evils of slavery were heavily punished. In the slave states, people could be imprisoned for 10 years for having a copy of _Uncle Tom's Cabin_, a book that showed slavery in a sympathetic light. Draepetomania represents what I call a _blind belief_ where people believe something because authorities make it the safe or convenient thing to believe, not because it's true. In other words, it was safe for doctors to believe the runaway slaves had mental illnesses, and it was unsafe to see runaways as healthy and slavery as evil.

Likewise in the Soviet Union and China in the mid 20th century, the government and society were assumed to be great and getting better, so any activists who fought corruption were assumed to have mental illnesses too. Many activists were arrested and accused of having mental disturbances and sent to prison hospitals where they were treated like the political prisoners they were. These activists were behaving appropriately and trying to serve their people, and authorities made up theories of mental illness as a cover story to justify imprisoning them.

In this social pattern, authorities punish people for speaking the truth, making it safe and socially acceptable to believe falsehoods. Unfortunately, this can also cause huge amounts of racism and hatred in a society, as authorities encourage people to adopt racist or hateful attitudes, and punish those who don't.

The Ku Klux Klan was a campaign of paramilitary violence operated by wealthy ex-slaveowners in the US South after the US Civil War. Most Americans know that terrible violence was directed at black people to scare them into remaining second class citizens. But few know that this campaign also attacked any white people who sympathized with oppressed black people!

In other words, whites who were racist were left alone or even rewarded. Any anti-racist white people risked rape, murder, having their house burned, or other atrocities. This has been a major driver of anti-black racism in the US South: authorities wanted that racism to avoid solidarity among poor white and black people, and for centuries they brutally punished any white people who stood up to confront racial injustices. Many KKK members were sheriffs and politicians, so the law was part of the problem!

Similar stories abound from unhealthy cultures around the world. Nazi Germans and Soviet citizens were each trained by their governments to hate the other side during World War II. Anyone who didn't hate enough risked being called a sympathizer and traitor and going to jail. When these authorities wanted war, they propagated hatred among the populace and punished anyone who spoke the truth and refused to hate.

Why did so many Germans learn to hate Jewish people after World War I? Well, the German monarchy, business leaders, and generals had really screwed up and lost the war. Knowing it was a foregone conclusion, they surrendered before the enemy had crossed into German territory. Unfortunately, they had lied to the German public, and the media contained propaganda which said they were winning the war until the moment they surrendered. Thus many Germans were really confused: why did they surrender if they were winning?

The political, military and business leaders wanted to avoid accountability for losing the war and spreading lies, so they propagated a "stab-in-the-back" narrative, blaming Jews, labor activists, liberals, and others for undermining the country from within.

A tragic number of Germans believed this nonsense, and it wasn't an accident: propagating hate and ignorance towards Jews and activists and blaming them for Germany's WWI defeat was just a way for the ruling class to avoid accountability. Tragically this was one step on the road to the Nazi's holocaust a few years later.

### And It Continues Today

Racism, hatred, and ignorance can be widely propagated by authorities to avoid accountability, sabotage solidarity, promote imperial wars, and other reasons. It can be challenging to recognize because authorities will often punish someone for one secret reason, but publicly accuse them of something different. For example, present-day Germans who oppose war with Russia have been called "Putin-trolls", a reference to Russian president Putin, essentially calling them traitors instead of brave activists trying to stop an unnecessary war.

In another present-day example, the United States continues to support Israel's genocide of the Palestinians. Israel has occupied Palestine for decades, keeping Palestinians under intense surveillance. The control was so tight that even many years ago the Israelis were literally counting the calories of food being allowed in to keep the Palestinians at starvation levels.

The Israelis began their all-out genocide in October 2023, with tremendous US support in the form of weapons, surveillance, fuel, political cover at the United Nations, and more. But just how bad has the violence been? Many news stories say that only 40-50,000 Palestinians have died -- surely a tragedy, but not genocide.

Before the present conflict started in October 2023, the Palestinian population in Gaza was estimated at 2.2 million. When US president Trump took office in February 2025, he stated the Palestinian population was around 1.7-1.8 million. Other estimates confirm this, using normal techniques to estimate military and civilian casualties in war. So between October 2023 and February 2025, Israelis had killed ~400,000-500,000 people through military violence, famine, disease, and so on while extremely few Israelis have died in comparison.

How have the Israeli and American governments trained their populations to tolerate and even support this genocide? You guessed it: spreading racist and hateful propaganda about Palestinians, and punishing anyone who tried to speak the truth and stand up for what's right.

Many government statements have called the Palestinians subhumans who deserve immense cruelty. For example, Israel's defense minister Yoav Gallant said, "We are fighting human animals and we are acting accordingly." Israelis have been trained to see Palestinians as a threat on par with Nazi Germany, rather than victims of a cruel occupation.

In Israel, one school girl expressed sympathy with the Palestinians, saying she hoped they could return to their homes soon. She was suspended from school as other students threatened to burn her house down and the Ministry of Education accused her of "incitement against IDF [Israeli] soldiers."

In America, we see similar disturbances. Anyone who tries to acknowledge the truth about Israeli aggression towards Palestinians is accused of antisemitism -- as if opposing Israeli genocide and being racist towards Jews were the same thing, which obviously they are not.**

President Trump is deporting many people for attending what he calls "illegal" protests and he accuses universities of tolerating antisemitism for allowing protests against the genocide. This is only an expansion of the policy that his predecessor president Biden started, as the genocide clearly has support from both major political parties.

Similar manipulative behavior is happening in many other countries, including Germany, Australia, and the United Kingdom.

And it's not just the government that tries to scare protesters away from acknowledging the truth: many business leaders want to scare people into submission too. One businessman, Kevin O'Leary, went on television and said that all activists were being monitored with AI-enabled cameras, their protesting would be recorded and show up in background checks, and they would never be hired again! In fact, North Carolina outlawed wearing face masks outside to make this surveillance even easier.

Just like American slave owners scared poor and middle class white people into hating black people or remaining silent so they wouldn't oppose slavery, modern day authorities are trying to scare us into submission so we won't oppose their genocide.

And just like authorities have attacked or killed spiritual leaders in the past, the same thing is happening today as authorities attack or kill the activists showing the most bravery, wisdom, and generosity to try to stop the massacre of Palestinians. American authorities imprisoned Mahmoud Khalil for his activist work against the genocide, just like the Germans arrested Majed Abusalama and the British arrested Huda Ammori. Countless thousands of others, in every country whose rulers strongly support the genocide, have also been persecuted for opposing it.**

Why are so many governments and corporate leaders supporting this genocide? People can only speculate: is it part of a plan for creating a major new west-Asian trade route through Israel? Accessing gas deposits off the Gaza coast? Developing beachfront real estate? All the above, or something else? When leaders are unaccountable, it can be difficult to know their true motivations.

So let's take stock: the protests are appropriate, the Israeli genocide against Palestine is real, and it's not antisemitic to point these things out. But a strong coalition of American, German, Australian, Israeli, and other business and political leaders around the world have decided to support this genocide, and they're punishing people for standing for what's right by accusing them of antisemitism and using this as a cover story to justify punishing them.

This shows how ancient patterns of nations with rulers (or ruling classes) are playing out right now. These countries may not have kings, but anytime one person or a group can impose law on the rest, and choose how that law is enforced, we end up with the same kind of tyranny. This is predictable in any society where people are punished for upholding their own law (because enforcing the law is the police's job, but of course they have to follow orders).

Ancient Rome, Germany, the Soviet Union, Israel, Canada, communist China, capitalist United States -- all of them have shown this pattern where unaccountable leaders punish truth-tellers and propagate racism and hatred when it suits them. _All these countries are actually dictatorships: cultures where some people dictate the law, and everyone else is expected to obey it._

This isn't the only dynamic that leads to racism and hate in unhealthy cultures, though it is sadly common. Authorities may encourage divisive racism in countless ways, even when they pretend not to. For example, many governments pretend to administer justice fairly, but actually punish some groups of people with longer prison sentences for the same crime, as seen in academic studies in China, the United States, and the United Kingdom. Then authorities pretend that more-oppressed groups are just more inherently violent or bad. Sadly many people fall for these scams of racism and hatred, believing some groups really are better than others.

When people are trapped with selfish and unaccountable leaders, the results are always tragic. What would it take for a group of people to select the most selfless and honest leaders instead?

<div class="rev-act-body">When all you hear are terrible stories about a country or ethnicity, it can be hard to remember that they're just people too. But if you knew someone from that country or ethnicity that you admired, you're much less likely to fall for manipulative racist and hateful propaganda.<br/><br/>Think of a country or ethnicity that your government or news media commonly report in very negative ways. Then find a person from there that you can admire or learn from. You could look for such a person who lives nearby, or if you cannot find anyone, go to the library and look for stories there. If you live in the United States, I suggest finding someone from Russia, Iran or Palestine.<br/><br/>For example, Vasily Arkhipov was a Russian naval officer working in a Soviet submarine during the Cuban Missile Crisis. One day during that tense standoff with the US in 1962, the two most senior officers wanted to launch nuclear weapons, falsely thinking that war had broken out after an American ship dropped explosives near their submarine. All 3 top officers had to agree in order to fire the nuclear weapons, but Arkhipov, the most junior of the three officers, did not believe war had broken out, did not bow to pressure, and refused to agree to launch nuclear weapons. He was right, war had not begun, and his integrity under pressure prevented global nuclear war and saved the lives of countless people.<br/><br/>Finding a person to learn from does not mean you need to support any of these countries' governments. But if you're ever tempted to feel racism or hatred towards a whole country or group, the admirable person you find will remind you that they're just people too, probably stuck in an unhealthy culture like you.</div></div>

### Healthy Cultures Choose Leaders Who Serve the People

Selfish rulers who encourage divisive racism and hate contrast vividly with generous servant-leaders of healthy cultures. What is it about healthy cultures that allows them to have selfless, generous servant-leaders? 

Do they just vote every few years and complain about politicians between elections? Do they believe that "god" chose their leader, and despite the endless corruption, do they have "faith" that "god's will" is being carried out?

It turns out that it is everyone's responsibility to ensure that only the most selfless people become leaders. Can you imagine having leaders who are so humble that they would never campaign for office? How would they even become leaders then?

Martín Prechtel described how Tzutujil Mayan leaders gave away their wealth each time they reached a new level of leadership, putting them on the same level as everyone else -- and these leaders were expected to _never campaign for office_.

Likewise, traditional Cheyenne warriors were trained from childhood never to brag about their moments of bravery, instead trusting that other warriors would tell their stories on their behalf.

It's everyone's responsibility to notice people's good deeds and retell their stories so that people's reputation can grow without any campaigning or bragging.

If you want to be able to live in a healthy culture, with leaders who serve the people instead of selfishly serving themselves, _notice other people's good deeds and tell their stories_. This is based on that first core spiritual practice of practical, aware gratitude for the gifts of others. Each good deed is a gift, and one way to receive that gift graciously is to tell the story so that others know.

When you notice someone who consistently tells the truth even when they could get away with lying, let the person know that you see them, and when appropriate, tell the stories to other people. When someone keeps a promise even when they really don't feel like it, tell the story. When someone consistently shows up to meetings early and well-prepared and helps the group make good decisions, tell those stories. When someone is a source of calm and good humor in difficult moments, or gives generously when they think no one's looking -- _tell those stories_ so that the person's reputation grows.

This is how a group can select the most humble, generous, honest, and capable leaders, including people who would never campaign for a leadership role. When everyone in a culture practices noticing good deeds and retelling the stories, the reputations of the best leaders grow naturally. When it's time to pick a leader, the people will know who it should be.

Given that some healthy cultures have had many tens of thousands of people, and spanned up to 40,000 square miles or more, this practice doesn't just work at the village level, but can help nations of any size choose the best leaders at every level.

I love telling stories of others' good deeds -- it's fun! Who doesn't like telling and hearing good news? Who doesn't like encouraging and rewarding good behavior? Every retelling is a little celebration.

One Nootka storyteller described the importance of "the mirror in the eyes of the people you love." When someone feels unseen and unappreciated, it can be discouraging. When people know that their neighbors and coworkers see them and feel grateful for their good deeds, they're likely to do more good deeds in the future. It simply feels good to give to grateful people. 

This is the power of that practical, aware gratitude to encourage more good behavior in the world, and every single person has this power. In a healthy culture or healthy subculture, this is a key way that you can help choose leaders who actually serve the people instead of selfishly serving themselves.
