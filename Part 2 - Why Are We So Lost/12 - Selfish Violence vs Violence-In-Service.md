## Chapter 12: Selfish Violence vs Violence-In-Service

Growing up in the United States, I heard a lot of people say that peace is good, and violence is bad. And sure, peace may be preferable, but when another group attacks, and escape is impossible, a group of people may face a choice: use violence in self-defense, or submit to the attackers.

Even though I desire peace, I don't see violence as inherently good or bad -- it's a question of how a person or group uses violence. Do they use violence selfishly, hurting others for their own personal benefit and lying about it? Or do people use violence in service of the group, in a way that benefits the people and nonhumans they love?

### Selfish Violence in Unhealthy Cultures

In unhealthy cultures where people are not able to hold their leaders accountable, selfish violence is common. Often the leaders want to go to war for selfish reasons that would never motivate the public to go along.

After all, who would want to risk their lives just to help rich people become a little richer? Knowing this, politicians will make up all sorts of fake motivations for the war, and peace activists will notice the lies and try to point out the truth. Then politicians will accuse the peace activists of being traitors spreading enemy propaganda to keep the country from uniting in support of the military. As Nazi leader Hermann Goering said after World War II, "whether it is a democracy or a fascist dictatorship or a parliament or a communist dictatorship... It works the same way in any country."

Currently in Germany, the United States, and many other countries, anyone who opposes increased war against Russia in Ukraine risks being called a "Putin lover" or "Putin troll" -- Vladimir Putin being the president of Russia. Politicians in these countries maintain the fiction that Russia invaded Ukraine unprovoked. But when activists try to point out all the provocations to avoid an unnecessary war -- such as the NATO military alliance expanding to Russian borders, putting nuclear-capable missiles on Russian borders, and arming the Ukrainian military for the purpose of going to war with Russia --  they are accused of spreading Russian propaganda.

A common way for rulers to motivate the public to fight a war that will only benefit the rulers and the rich is to stage a fraudulent attack, known as a "false flag" attack. Rulers commit violence against their own people, and then blame it on the group or country they want to attack. In 1939, the Soviet military attacked one of their own towns in secret, blamed the Finnish, and used that as an excuse to start the Winter War against Finland. The Nazi Germans burned their own parliament building but blamed it on the communists as an excuse to outlaw the Communist party in Germany.

In 1999, the Russian federal police secretly planted bombs in Russian apartment buildings, and hundreds of people died. Some people became suspicious when a federal parliament member accidentally described one of the bombings before it happened. They became more suspicious when local police actually caught some of the perpetrators planting a live bomb -- and the perps turned out to be Russian federal police agents! No one was punished for this. But the government blamed the attacks on Osama bin Laden and soon invaded Chechnya on the pretense of protecting Russia from terrorists.

Likewise, in the United States the government blamed Osama bin Laden for the 9/11 attacks in 2001, and used these as an excuse to invade Afghanistan and Iraq. However, in recent years the US federal police have revealed documents indicating that Saudi nationals on the payroll of the Saudi embassy supported the 9/11 attacks, including helping the 9/11 attackers with lodging, financing, and travel. The Saudi ambassador was the billionaire prince Bandar, a good friend of the US president George HW Bush, and both of their wealth was heavily tied to oil production. Plenty of other evidence casts doubt on official explanations of the attacks. Somehow, the Saudis and Bush family escaped any investigation or punishment for their support of the 9/11 attacks. Like the Russian government, the American government leaders got the war they wanted.

Whether Russia, the USA, Ireland, Germany, France, Tibet, Great Britain, or any other unhealthy culture, the core problem is the same: people have allowed selfishness to take hold in their culture, and most people resign themselves to tolerating abuse and not standing for what's right.

Many people hesitate to believe these stories, because it is so repugnant to imagine people of one's own country lying and acting so deeply selfishly. It's even more disturbing when it is the unaccountable leaders themselves acting so hurtfully.

This is simply a typical problem in cultures that tolerate selfishness and abuse, and do not hold their leaders accountable. This sort of selfish behavior simply continues endlessly, while peace activists are punished for standing for the truth and trying to avoid unnecessary, selfish violence. 

### Violence-in-Service in Healthy Cultures and Subcultures

Stories of collective self-defense show how people can use violence responsibly, in service of their communities and the common good.

#### Violence in Service, Example 1: The Black Panthers

The Black Panthers were an American black revolutionary organization active in the 1960s and 1970s. While they had many programs, including making clothing and breakfasts available to poor black children, one of their most famous actions was to have a few warriors trail police cars. When the police officers would pull over another motorist, these Panthers would pull over within seeing distance behind the police car. Without interfering at all, the Panthers displayed weapons, letting the officers know that they would take a stand if the officers acted abusively.

These warriors didn't risk violence for personal gain. They acted to protect their community by upholding the laws they lived by and holding the police accountable for misbehavior, and they inspired huge numbers of people to join the Panthers. I believe one reason so many people joined the Panthers was exactly this willingness to stand for what's right even at personal risk, using violence if needed in service of the community.

#### Violence in Service, Example 2: The Apache

The Bedonkohe Apache warrior Geronimo offered another example of violence-in-service. His people believed they were at peace with the Mexicans, and so when he and many other warriors went into a Mexican town to trade, they only left behind a token force to protect the camp and the women, children, and elders. When the warriors returned, they found that Mexican soldiers had killed the entire protection force and many of their families. Geronimo had lost more than anyone -- his mother, wife, and all his children were dead. He later told his biographer, "I had lost all."

The warriors did not have enough weapons or people to stand up to the Mexicans that night, so they left to safety. After replenishing supplies, chief Mangus-Colorado called a war council, and the warriors decided to go to war. They invited other Apache groups to participate, and Geronimo went to them one by one, telling them what had happened, and asking them to participate in a war against the Mexicans.

There was no draft, and none of the warriors were poor people seeking to escape poverty. Each one decided for themselves to fight as he or she saw fit, knowing the risks and deciding if the benefit was worth it. Geronimo recruited many people.

Finally all the warriors assembled. They had set several safe havens where the wives, children and other noncombatants would safely stay, ensuring everyone in their communities was taken care of. Instead of putting the richest or most politically powerful person in charge, the Apache agreed to make Geronimo their war leader, knowing he was extremely motivated to defeat the Mexicans after what he'd lost.

Finally they tracked down the Mexicans, including two companies of infantry and two of cavalry. Geronimo sent flanking detachments and led advances over hours of vicious fighting. Many Mexicans and Apaches died, but in the end only Apache warriors remained, having fully vanquished the Mexicans.

#### Violence in Service, Example 3: The Zapatistas

The Zapatistas are a healthy culture in southern North America, many of whose members are from local indigenous groups. After 500 years of oppression by the Spanish and Mexicans, and 10 years of careful planning, they rose up in revolution on January 1st, 1994. Unlike shallow revolutions that replace one ruling class with another, so that people remain submissive and their lives don't change much, the Zapatistas remembered how to have a healthy culture where everyone upholds their laws. 

The Mexican military and the Zapatista military, known as the EZLN, clashed almost immediately in the Zapatistas' home region of Chiapas, Mexico in the south east. Official fighting continued until a ceasefire was called.

However, this official ceasefire was not the end of the violence. The Mexican Ministry of Defense illegally organized paramilitary forces to attack the Zapatistas. People fired machine guns into Zapatista villages, cut off people's limbs, and many others were disappeared, executed, or displaced from their homes. Police and military attacked them with dozens of helicopters and many thousands of soldiers.

However, major Ana María said, "the Zapatista Army is very large and is everywhere." They persevered in solidarity with each other and the Earth.

They wanted a culture based on mutual respect, and they maintained this respect even during war. No one was forced into military service. Each person chose for themselves if they would risk their life in fighting. Women played key roles from the beginning. A woman major led the Zapatistas in taking the town of San Cristóbal de las Casas in Chiapas. Commander Ramona played a major part in the resulting peace dialog. As of 2004, 45% of Zapatista army members were women.

They practiced a deep humility, not letting anyone feel like they were special or better than the rest because of their position. When describing their top military leader, Ana María said, "Marcos, like all the members of the [core planning committee], knows nothing and is nothing. Marcos is just another representative..."

Immediately the Zapatistas put into effect laws which they had prepared in advance. Many women had given input to decide the laws they would live by, and after the revolution, sexism dramatically diminished. Interviews with many Zapatista women in 2014 showed that the changes were real and lasting.

They passed laws preserving the seas, rivers, and forests. People could keep enough land to sustain their family, but no one was allowed to hoard land or property. When individuals owned more than a certain number of acres, the extra was redistributed for communal farming. Anyone who hoarded wealth was considered a traitor, ensuring there would be no rich people to try and corrupt the leadership and society from within.

They ended property taxes and vastly reduced rents. Everyone was free to arm themselves and uphold their laws, and even organize their own self-protection groups. All prisoners were released except murderers, rapists, and drug trafficking bosses. They developed a system of leadership that ensured that no one passed laws on anyone else. Rather, different layers of councils, each layer covering a larger area, helped coordinate cooperation and collective self-defense as needed.

One commander said, "Para todos, todo, para nosotros nada" -- For everyone, everything; for us, nothing. They offer their gifts for the good of the group. This person acknowledged that being a Zapatista was difficult. They sometimes only have hard tortillas to eat, and sometimes they fall sick due to poor food. They often sleep on hard floors or can't sleep for days and nights. Their lives are often at risk.

But he also said why they do this: "As Zapatistas, we have been declared terrorists for simply wanting to live, for asking for food, for health care... But for us, in the eyes of the true man and true woman, terrorism is greed, racism, hate, and war. For true change, we are ready to die with dignity, in resistance, instead of waiting to die from curable diseases and hunger."

One fighter noted, "We will always carry resistance and rebellion in our hearts, because we are guardians of Mother Earth, we are not the owners. The Earth is not ours, it belongs to all of us who fight for life. We were born in it, we live in it, we are going to take care of it and we are going to protect it -- and if necessary, we will die for it."

The Black Panthers, Apaches, and Zapatistas showed what it's like to use violence in service of the community. No one in these stories used violence selfishly. 

I suspect everyone in these stories would have preferred peace. But when the options are either self-defense or submission, each of us must make a choice. They chose violence in service of the people they loved and in service of the Earth.
