## Chapter 7: Why Are People So Selfish?

In every healthy nation I've studied, elders train children to be generous and to see selfishness as a threat to their way of life.

Sioux man Sitting Bull said, "Love of possessions is a disease,"[xxx-indian heroes and great chieftains|sitting bull] and Sioux man Ohiyesa described how he "was trained to be a warrior and a hunter, and not to care for money or possessions, but to be in the broadest sense a public servant."[xxx-from deep woods to civilization|the way opens] Potawatomi woman Robin Kimmerer described how traditional elders would tell children scary stories of what might happen if they act selfishly.[xxx-braiding sweetgrass|windigo footprints]

When one or a few people act selfishly, the nation can respond by helping them feel comfortable sharing again, or if necessary, evict them if they continue to behave selfishly.

But what happens when a ruling class forces laws on the rest, protecting their own wealth at all costs and forbidding people from standing for what's right? What happens when selfishness is systematically rewarded and maintained, and people can no longer maintain a way of life based on sharing?

### Profit Economies Reward and Maintain Selfishness

Ruling classes consistently impose a way of life that rewards selfishness, creating a _profit economy._ "Profit" means getting more than one gives, and this is widely encouraged in profit economies that _move resources to people who already have them._ The more wealth a person has, the more additional wealth they are able to get.

Capitalism, socialism, and communism are all types of profit economy. Rich people control most of the wealth in capitalism, while the government controls more in socialism and communism.

There are two major kinds of profit economy: market and command. Most unhealthy nations have some mix of both.

Command economies are simple: an authority figure gives an order, and a trapped person obeys the order or gets severely punished. Militaries, chattel slave plantations, and prisons are all command economies. Workers don't choose their bosses, and if workers choose not to work, they receive direct, severe abuse.

Market economies offer more flexibility. Workers can generally choose their boss, choose their type of job, or choose not to work. But unless they are independently wealthy, people who don't work for money face poverty, social isolation, shame, and worse.

While fear of physical punishment motivates workers in command economies, the fear of poverty and low status motivates compliance in market economies. Any form of coerced labor is slavery, and in the 1800s wage jobs were recognized as _wage slavery._

Whether a lower class person is trying to survive, a middle-class person is trying to keep their comforts, or an entrepreneur is trying to get rich, all of them work for money and so all of them ultimately serve the people with money: the rich and the government which is the source of most money in the first place.

Market economies give wage slaves the flexibility to choose their job, and politicians commonly pretend that this flexibility is the same as freedom. Politicians pretend that the wage slaves live in a free country, and they should be proud and grateful.

Soviet leaders claimed to guarantee citizens' "freedom, democracy, and basic human rights,"[xxx-stasi east german secret police|the sword of repression] while Canadian leadership likewise pretends to care about "defending human rights and democracy."[xxx-statement canada prime minister rights] Socialism and capitalism are just different forms of market economy that allow politicians to pretend that the workers are free.

People of healthy nations -- who currently or in recent times lived in actual freedom -- recognize this truth. Sitting Bull said "The life of white men is slavery. They are prisoners in their towns or farms."[xxx-griid sitting bull speech] When people must work for others to survive, and are not allowed to choose their own laws nor uphold the laws they obey, widespread selfishness results, and that's what a slave society looks like.

#### Maintaining Financial Desperation in Market Economies

Authorities use a vast number of techniques to make people feel financially desperate and willing to do work they don't want to do in order to earn money. As a result, many people sacrifice important things like their integrity, health, and family time just to survive.

Different ruling classes manage their economies in different ways in order to maintain desperation and maximize productivity, but there are some common patterns.

Without a job, workers may not be able to pay for housing, food, or health care for their family. Inflation continuously saps the value of previous savings, meaning the money starts to lose value as soon as it is earned. Even relatively well-paid workers often fear not having enough money for retirement, losing a job, or having a health crisis.

Banks and landlords regulate the prices of houses and apartments, calculating the proportion of people's monthly income that they can afford to pay in mortgage or rent. Controlling this debt-to-income ratio means house and rental prices increase at least as much as people's wages, keeping workers from "getting ahead." Property taxes force homeowners to pay to keep the house they already own.

Authorities may make the drawbacks of poverty arbitrarily more terrible, including putting poor people in prison, shaming the poor, forcing them to eat less nutritious food, or taking away their children when they struggle to provide safe, clean homes.

Financial desperation leads to _coerced consent,_ where workers who are desperate for money will consent to their own exploitation, each person choosing the least-bad job just to stay alive. People will even beg for a job where they can serve a master because even if they are being exploited, at least they can survive.[xxx-odoc|ch10]

In contrast, people of healthy nations have often been called lazy because they only work as hard as needed and no harder. Calling them lazy simultaneously shames them while tricking wage slaves into thinking that endless drudgery is virtuous.[xxx-canada lazy indian]<sup>,</sup>[xxx-australia lazy indian]

Insecurity is common at all levels of wealth. The poor have little money, and they may not know month to month how they will make ends meet. Even the rich feel insecure, knowing that their wealth is the only thing allowing them to live comfortably. With insecurity so widespread, is it any wonder so many people cling to whatever money they can get?

Desperation causes many people to sacrifice their integrity, making it very difficult to have meaningful political conversations. This explains the famous quote from Upton Sinclair: "It is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends upon his not understanding it."[xxx-quote investigator upton]

For example, coal miners commonly refuse to believe in climate change[xxx-coal climate change], and weapons manufacturers often refuse to consider how governments use their weapons.[xxx-weapons-used] Intentionally or not, nearly everyone in unhealthy nations supports inappropriate behavior, whether they work for dishonest news media, manufacture goods with toxic materials, or a thousand other ways.

People with integrity face this reality, but few do, as people would recognize that their way of life contributes to big problems in the world, and they might feel the urge to quit their job. But quitting might lead to poverty, perhaps permanently, affecting any family members too. Thus many people say or believe whatever they need to in order to keep the income or wealth they've acquired.

_Profit economies make it dangerous to have integrity._ Thus it's not just politicians who are corrupt. In one way or another, profit economies corrupt nearly everybody, from the topmost political leaders and business executives to the vast majority of individuals.

Of course, some people have a comfortable life in their profit economy, and maybe you're one of them. If so, do you think this does not pertain to you? Perhaps you like your job, your company has an ethical-sounding mission statement, and you have enough money to survive and even enjoy your days off. Maybe you also have money for a rainy day or retirement. Maybe you are sitting pretty.

But consider this. Can you stop? Can you step off your treadmill and quit working for money whenever you please to focus on more meaningful work? And if you did, how long could you keep it up? Unless you have megawealth, some day you would have to return to paid work or face financial desperation. Maybe your friends or family would help you for a while, but sooner or later, you'd likely be in trouble. Unlike those in healthy nations, in the profit economy of an unhealthy nation, you're not surrounded by people who will share food and shelter and ensure your survival needs are met during difficult times.

And if you do have megawealth, you know deep down that you'd better not lose it, or you'll really learn what financial desperation is like.

Perhaps you think that wouldn't happen to you, but the fact that you do not dare step off your job treadmill for very long or risk your retirement savings is proof that you don't want to risk it. Whether we think much about it or not, we are all aware that we must work for money in order to survive and advance in our profit economy. 

And therefore the well-off are as trapped as anyone else. The paychecks may vary but the trap is the same. Yes, in a market economy you can choose your job, your boss, and your potential advancement. But the one thing you cannot choose is to not participate. You, just like me and everyone else, are trapped.

### Gift Economies Reward and Maintain Generosity

Unlike profit economies that reward selfishness, gift economies reward sharing. To ensure that everyone is taken care of, gift economies move resources to where they are the most needed or where they will do the most good. 

I experienced a gift economy among the Ashaninka where sharing food, tools, land, water, and other resources was clearly the norm. Plenty of other people living in other healthy nations, past and present, show that this community-wide and nation-wide sharing is not particularly unusual.

Nancy Basket, a woman of Cherokee descent, summarized the traditional Cherokee culture of sharing this way: "If we all had a lot, then everybody had a lot. If there wasn't a whole lot, then no one had a whole lot."[xxx-basket interview]

Sioux man Ohiyesa described the Sioux culture of sharing when he wrote, "During the summer, when Nature is at her best, and provides abundantly for the [Indian], it seems to me that no life is happier than his! Food is free -- lodging free -- everything free! All were alike rich in the summer, and, again, all were alike poor in the winter and early spring."[xxx-indian child life|early hardships]

Amazingly, when people born into profit economies encounter people born into gift economies, they can each feel offended by the other. How is that possible?

#### Gift Economies and Indian Givers

One of my earliest childhood memories involves giving somebody a gift and noticing that they didn't use it. When I tried to take it back, I was called an "Indian giver." To be a generous gift-giver, I was supposed to release all interest in what happens to my gift after I give it. The gift becomes someone else's property and therefore is no longer any of my business.

Wanting to avoid the scorn of being called an Indian giver, that's how I learned to give gifts -- first it belonged to me, and now it belongs to someone else.  It took decades for me to learn that this attitude towards sharing is rooted in private property ownership and essential to maintaining authoritarian nations. It turns out that my younger self had the healthier attitude to gift-giving.

In gift economies, people take responsibility to learn where gifts are most needed or valued, and everyone helps circulate gifts until they get to that highest use. This is where the derogatory phrase "Indian giver" comes from: people of North American healthy nations (known as Indians) sometimes gave gifts to European colonists, noticed they weren't being used, and thus asked for them back so the gifts could be given elsewhere. European colonists thus saw "Indian giving" as a violation of their private property rights.

Nancy Basket described how the Europeans commonly misunderstood the Cherokee gift economy: "We would know each other well enough to see what they might need. And if we would give somebody a gift and they didn't use it, we would be embarrassed. And we would either take it back or something else because it wasn't being used. She didn't need it. And people called us Indian givers for that."[xxx-basket interview]

"Indian giver" became a negative label for someone who gave a gift and now selfishly wants it back. In reality, they are behaving thoughtfully, noticing whether the gift is needed. If the gift goes unused, the so-called Indian giver exerts extra effort to retrieve the unused item and give it to someone else who needs it more.

Gift-economy practices can seem offensive to people in profit economies, and profit-economy practices can seem offensive to people in gift economies.

A person in a gift economy may feel upset if a person accepts a gift, doesn't use it, and then refuses to pass it on to someone else. A person from a profit economy may feel upset if they receive a gift only to find that the giver wants it back. Both sides may feel offended, and it reflects a fundamentally different perspective on sharing (and trusting others to share) versus hoarding (and not trusting others to share). Do gifts keep moving until they arrive where they are most needed? Or do people hoard possessions whether they need them or not?

Potawatomi woman Robin Kimmerer noted the consequences when she wrote, "If all the world is a commodity, how poor we grow. When all the world is a gift in motion, how wealthy we become."[xxx-braiding sweetgrass|the gift of strawberries]

This attitude to gift-giving stems from the deep recognition that all of life is simply the giving of divine gifts. Every spider, bear, bush, and cloud is giving its sacred gifts and somehow contributing to the web of life. Who would want to stop all that giving? Gift economies aim to circulate gifts rather than hoard them, and this kind of human economy fits in well with the larger nonhuman economy of all life.

When whole nations embrace a gift economy, their way of life benefits the living world. When humans form reciprocal relationships with nonhumans, giving to the plant and animal communities while gratefully receiving enough to live, the whole ecosystem benefits from the humans' presence.

Gift economies have many practical benefits. They move resources from the haves to the have-nots, minimizing inequality. They ensure neighbors take care of each other. People might face scarcity together occasionally, but nobody suffers poverty alone while others have abundance. Gift economies help people take care of each other whenever a big challenge arises.

Gift economies also make it easier to develop and keep one's integrity. When a person isn't afraid of poverty, it becomes easier to face reality, even when it's unpleasant.

When everybody is expected to stand for what's right, this is the way of life that results -- a life of shared abundance. As Okanagan woman Jeannette Armstrong said, "_The realization that people and community are there to sustain you creates the most secure feeling in the world..._"[xxx-original instructions|armstrong]

In unhealthy nations where a few people dominate the rest and authorities forbid people from seeking justice and upholding their own laws, most people are left trying to survive and get as comfortable as possible. Widespread selfishness is the result.

But it doesn't have to be this way. Individuals, communities, and whole nations are capable of generosity when everyone stands for a culture of mutual respect, and nobody rules over anybody else.

<div class="rev-act-body">How can you form new friendships where sharing is the norm? Someone needs to give first to start a relationship of generous reciprocity.<br/><br/>Think of three ways you could give something to a total stranger, not knowing or caring whether or not they would respond generously. For example, you could mentor a child or make a nutritious meal for someone who's sick or recovering from childbirth. Without any expectation of return, give to strangers in ways that, even if the relationship ended immediately, it would be ok. Notice which people show gratitude and give back in their own ways over time, and what relationships of reciprocity form.<br/><br/>When I was 12, I was in the lunch line in school, and a boy ahead of me discovered he didn't have money. I didn't know him, but I offered to buy him lunch, and he became one of my best friends. This taught me to give first before I've received anything, and just see what happens.</div></div>

<div class="rev-act-body">Trading and bartering don't involve generosity because they are even exchanges in the moment. When you receive someone's gift and try to make it an equal exchange by giving them something, you're not acknowledging their generosity and allowing your gratitude to grow. You're essentially receiving the object but rejecting the generosity behind it.<br/><br/>Next time someone does something kind for you, just say thanks and enjoy receiving the gift. Whether they're giving you a compliment, making you a meal, or anything else, do not try to give back something of equal value in the moment. Instead, let your feeling of gratitude grow and trust that you'll find ways to give back in reciprocity over time. If you do want to give the other person something, clarify that you're also giving a gift and not making a trade.</div></div>
