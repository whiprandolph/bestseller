## Chapter 7: Why Are People So Selfish?

Elders in every healthy nation I've studied consistently train children to be generous, and to see selfishness as a threat to their way of life.

Sioux man Sitting Bull said, "Love of possessions is a disease,"[xxx-indian heroes and great chieftains|sitting bull] and Sioux man Ohiyesa described his upbringing: "I was trained to be a warrior and a hunter, and not to care for money or possessions, but to be in the broadest sense a public servant."[xxx-from deep woods to civilization|the way opens] Potawatomi woman Robin Kimmerer described how traditional Potawatomi elders would tell their children scary stories of what might happen if they act selfishly, and if selfishness were allowed to take hold in their society.[xxx-braiding sweetgrass|windigo footprints]

When one or a few people act selfishly, the nation can respond by helping them feel comfortable sharing again, or if necessary, evict them if they continue to behave selfishly.

But what happens when a ruling class forces laws on the rest, protecting their own wealth at all costs and forbidding people from standing for what's right? What happens when selfishness is allowed to fester, and people can no longer maintain a way of life based on sharing?

### Profit Economy: When Selfishness is Allowed to Take Hold

Tragically, ruling classes consistently impose a way of life that rewards selfishness, creating a _profit economy_. The word "profit" simply means getting more than one gives. Profit economies reward and motivate individuals to try to get more than they give, training people to profit from their neighbors. Over time, profit economies _move resources toward people who already have them_. In a profit economy, the more resources a person has, the more additional resources they are able to get.

Capitalism, socialism, and communism are all examples of profit economies. The main difference is simply whether wealthy individuals and corporations control most property (capitalism) or whether the ruling government controls a larger share (socialism and communism).

I see two major kinds of profit economies: market economies and command economies. Most unhealthy nations have some mix of both.

Command economies are simple: an authority figure gives an order, and a trapped person obeys the order or gets severely punished. Militaries, chattel slave plantations, and prisons are all command economies. Workers don't choose their bosses, and if workers choose not to work, they receive direct, severe abuse.

In market economies, workers can often choose their boss and even their type of job. Anybody has the choice not to work. But unless they are independently wealthy, people who don't work for money face poverty, social isolation, shame, and worse. Whereas the fear of physical punishment motivates workers in command economies, the fear of poverty and low social status motivates compliance in market economies.

### Market Economies: The Flexibility to Choose Your Master

In market economies, people are trapped in a financial system in which they need money in order to survive. Unless they are among the few rich, most people have to constantly work a job or face financial desperation. Even those who earn more than they need must keep working because it is difficult to save enough to avoid future financial desperation.

Many people in 2025 recognize chattel slave plantations or forced prison labor as forms of slavery, but in the 1800s, wage jobs were also known as "wage slavery." Any form of coerced labor is slavery, and wage slavery has two important advantages for ruling classes.

* _Advantage 1: Market economies are self-organizing slave societies_. Market economies are slave societies because they're based on coerced labor, keeping people in financial desperation and forcing them to find any paid work to survive. They are self-organizing because administrators do not need to order individual workers to do specific jobs. Workers will actively look for jobs, and if none are available, they may seek out training or move to other regions where there's work. Entrepreneurs will seek out business opportunities to try and get rich. All these people are trying to find ways to work for money, meaning everyone ultimately serves the people with the money: the rich and the government which is the source of most money in the first place.

* _Advantage 2: Politicians and businessmen can pretend that workers live in a free society_. Wage slaves can legally choose their job and where to live. This offers much more flexibility than in chattel slavery, prison slavery, or military slavery, and so politicians can pretend that wage slaves live in a free country, and they should be proud and grateful.

Soviet East German minister for state security Erich Milke once said, "The [German Democratic Republic] is a state that guarantees its citizens freedom, democracy, and basic human rights."[xxx-stasi east german secret police|the sword of repression] On Human Rights Day, Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau noted that, "defending human rights and democracy has always been, and will continue to be, a priority for Canada..."[xxx-statement canada prime minister rights] Whether socialist or capitalist, these are simply different forms of market economy that allow politicians to pretend that the workers are free.

People of healthy nations -- who currently or in recent times lived in actual freedom -- recognize the truth. Sitting Bull said "The life of white men is slavery. They are prisoners in their towns or farms."[xxx-griid sitting bull speech] When people are forced to work for others to survive, not allowed to choose their own laws, and not allowed to uphold the laws they obey, widespread selfishness results, and that's what a slave society looks like.

#### Maintaining Financial Desperation in Market Economies

Authorities use a vast number of techniques to make people feel financially desperate and willing to do work they don't want to do in order to earn money. As a result, many people sacrifice their integrity, health, family time, and other important things just to keep the job they need to survive. This financial desperation explains the famous quote from Upton Sinclair: "It is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends upon his not understanding it."[xxx-quote investigator upton]

Different ruling classes manage their economies very differently to maintain desperation and maximize productivity, but there are some common patterns.

Without a job, workers may not be able to pay for housing, food, or health care for their family. Inflation continuously saps the value of previous savings, meaning the money instantly becomes less valuable starting the moment it's earned. Even relatively well-paid workers may fear not having enough money for retirement, unexpectedly losing a job, or having a health crisis, and thus even well-off people can feel financially desperate as well.

Banks and landlords regulate the prices of houses and apartments, calculating the proportion of people's monthly income that they can afford to pay in mortgage or rent. This debt-to-income ratio means house prices and rental prices always increase at least as much as people's wages, keeping workers from "getting ahead." Property taxes force homeowners to pay to keep the house they already own.

Authorities may make the drawbacks of poverty arbitrarily terrible, including putting poor people in prison, shaming poor people, forcing poor people to eat less nutritious food, or taking away poor people's children when they struggle to provide safe, clean homes.

Authorities may allow crime and drugs in the poor parts of town, have the police mistreat poor people in a variety of ways, routinely underfund schools in the poor districts, and allow factory pollution to be worse in poor areas.

The financial desperation that powers most market economies also compels poor people to fight the wars of the rich. In unhealthy nations around the world, plenty of people join the police or military as a way to escape poverty or dangerous neighborhoods.

Prison labor also keeps wages low and workers desperate, as prisoners can be forced to do work for pennies per hour, or for nothing at all. Just as chattel slavery kept wages low in the Americas for centuries, prison slave-labor keeps wages low in many countries today.

Widespread financial desperation leads to _coerced consent_, where workers who are desperate for money will consent to their own exploitation, each person choosing the least-bad job just to survive.

Indeed, people will even beg for a job where they can serve a master because even if they are being exploited, at least they can survive. One petition by Russian workers to their government in 1906 acknowledged the master-worker dynamic: "Owing to unemployment, numberless workers' families are now without bread. The workers do not want charity, or doles. We demand work. The masters refuse to give us work."[xxx-communists and the fight for jobs and revolution] In protests in Bangladesh in 2014, unemployed laborers marched with signs saying "Chakri Pai!" ('we demand work!').[xxx-tandf bangladesh we demand work] In the United States in 1930, both white and black Americans marched with signs saying "We Demand Work or Wages."[xxx-washpo we demand work]

Insecurity is common at all levels of wealth. The poor have little money, and they may not know month to month how they will make ends meet. Even the rich feel insecure, knowing that their wealth is the only thing allowing them to live comfortably. With insecurity so widespread, is it any wonder so many people cling to whatever money they can get?

Of course, rulers do not need to force bankers, politicians, and individual bosses to play their part. All they need to do is create a profit-based economic system that consistently rewards selfishness, and the people who cultivate selfishness will inevitably take these roles and get rich, doing their part to maintain their profit economy.

Of course, some people have a comfortable life in their profit economy, and maybe you're one of them. If so, do you think none of this pertains to you? Perhaps you like your job, have adequate money to survive, and even extra money to enjoy your days off. Maybe you also have money in the bank for a rainy day or for your kids or retirement. Maybe you are sitting pretty. 

But let me ask you this. Can you stop? Can you step off your treadmill and quit working for money whenever you please to focus on more meaningful work? And if you did, how long could you keep it up? Unless you have megawealth, at some point you would have to return to some kind of paid work or face the consequences of financial desperation. Maybe your friends or family would help you out for a while, but sooner or later, you'd likely be in trouble. Unlike those in healthy nations, in the profit economies of an unhealthy nation, you're not surrounded by people who will feed you, shelter you, and make sure your survival needs are met during difficult moments.

And even if you do have megawealth, you know deep down that you'd better not lose it, or you'll really learn what financial desperation is like.

Perhaps you think that wouldn't happen to you, but the fact that you do not dare step off your job treadmill for very long is evidence enough that you don't want to risk it. Whether we think much about it or not, we are all aware that we must work for money in order to survive and advance in our profit economy. 

And therefore the well-off are as trapped as anyone else. Our paychecks may vary but the nature of our entrapment is the same. Yes, in a market economy you can choose your job, your boss, and your potential advancement. But the one thing you cannot choose is to not participate. You, just like me and everyone else, are trapped.

### Command Economies: When Your Master Chooses You

Authorities' underlying attitude in market economies is "find a way to serve us, or enjoy your poverty." Workers don't legally have to have a job, but they face poverty if they don't serve some master somewhere. However, in market economies the worst punishment for disobedience is usually just being fired. In command economies, the approach is more direct: "Obey my order, or I will punish you." Workers in these situations generally do not choose their boss and are physically punished if they do not follow orders.

For example, in US chattel slavery before the US Civil War, if a slave did not pick enough cotton in a day, the boss would whip them severely to motivate higher performance the next day.[xxx-half has never been told|1805-1861] "Chattel" means property, and chattel slavery is a system where some people can legally own others as property. Prisoners likewise do not get to choose their boss or their kind of work, and plenty of stories from the present-day United States, Russia, and other countries describe severe physical and sexual punishments for prisoners that disobey orders.[xxx-odoc|ch24]**

Militaries are command economies as well. When there is a draft, governments force people to join the military. Even when people volunteer, militaries commonly do not let soldiers leave at will for years after joining. Soldiers commonly don't choose their boss (commanding officer) and are imprisoned if they disobey orders.

Whether the workers are trying to avoid punishment or poverty, or the leaders are trying to get rich, every role helps reinforce the profit economy that ultimately generates wealth for the ruling class.

What would it be like to live in a nation without selfishness, where sharing was rewarded instead of profiting?

### Gift Economies Generate and Spread Abundance
Gift economies reward sharing. They ensure everyone is taken care of, moving resources to where they're most needed or where they serve the greatest good. 

I experienced a gift economy among the Ashaninka where sharing was clearly the norm. Plenty of other people living in other healthy nations, past and present, show that this is not particularly unusual.

Nancy Basket, a woman of Cherokee descent, summarized the traditional Cherokee culture of sharing this way: "If we all had a lot, then everybody had a lot. If there wasn't a whole lot, then no one had a whole lot."[xxx-basket interview]

Sioux man Ohiyesa described the Sioux culture of sharing when he wrote, "During the summer, when Nature is at her best, and provides abundantly for the [Indian], it seems to me that no life is happier than his! Food is free -- lodging free -- everything free! All were alike rich in the summer, and, again, all were alike poor in the winter and early spring."[xxx-indian child life|early hardships]

Amazingly, when people born into profit economies encounter people born into gift economies, they can each feel offended by the other. How is that possible?

#### Gift Economies and Indian Givers

One of my earliest childhood memories involves giving somebody a gift and noticing that they didn't use it. When I tried to take it back, I was called an "Indian giver." I was told that to be a generous gift-giver, I was supposed to release all interest in what happens to my gift after I give it. I was told that the gift becomes someone else's property and therefore is no longer any of my business.

Wanting to avoid the scorn of being called an Indian giver, that's how I learned to give gifts -- first it belonged to me, and now it belongs to someone else.  It took decades for me to learn that this attitude towards sharing is rooted in private property ownership and essential to maintaining authoritarian nations. I was amazed to learn that my younger self had the healthier attitude to gift-giving.

All of life is simply divine beings giving their gifts. This is the recognition behind the first core spiritual practice of cultivating the practical, aware gratitude for the gifts of life. Chestnut trees give tasty chestnuts, stinging nettle plants heal joint pain, stars provide guidance, and the soil accepts and recycles us back after we die. All these beings give divine gifts that make life possible and beautiful. No one makes them do this. Humans play their role by giving their own sacred gifts too -- the second core spiritual practice.

In gift economies, people figure out where gifts are most needed or valued, and everyone helps circulate gifts until they get to that highest use. This is where the derogatory phrase "Indian giver" comes from: people of North American healthy nations (known as Indians) sometimes gave gifts to European colonists, noticed they weren't being used, and thus asked for them back so the gifts could be given elsewhere. European colonists thus saw "Indian giving" as a violation of their private property rights.

Nancy Basket described how the Cherokee would commonly ensure gifts got where they were needed, and how European colonists misunderstood this: "We would know each other well enough to see what they might need. And if we would give somebody a gift and they didn't use it, we would be embarrassed. And we would either take it back or something else because it wasn't being used. She didn't need it. And people called us Indian givers for that."[xxx-basket interview]

"Indian giver" became a negative label, describing someone who gave a gift and now selfishly wants it back. In reality, an Indian giver is behaving thoughtfully, paying attention to whether the gift is needed. If the gift goes unused, the so-called Indian giver exerts extra effort to retrieve the unused item and pass it along to someone else who needs it more.

Due to this fundamental difference between caring for others and caring primarily for oneself, the contrast between these two economies is striking. Gift-economy practices can seem offensive to people in profit economies, and profit-economy practices can seem offensive to people in gift economies.

A person in a gift economy may feel upset if a person accepts a gift, doesn't use it, and then refuses to pass it on to someone else. A person from a profit economy may feel upset if they receive a gift only to find that the giver wants it back. Both sides may feel offended, and it reflects a fundamentally different perspective on sharing (and trusting others to share) versus hoarding (and not trusting others to share). Do gifts keep moving until they arrive where they are most needed? Or do people hoard possessions whether they need them or not?

Potawatomi woman Robin Kimmerer noted the consequences when she wrote, "If all the world is a commodity, how poor we grow. When all the world is a gift in motion, how wealthy we become."[xxx-braiding sweetgrass|the gift of strawberries]

This healthy-nation attitude to gift-giving stems from the deep recognition that all of life is simply the giving of divine gifts. Every spider, bear, bush, and cloud is giving its sacred gifts and somehow contributing to the web of life. Who would want to stop all that giving? Gift economies aim to circulate gifts rather than hoard them, and this kind of human economy fits in well with the larger nonhuman economy of all life.

Gift economies also have many practical benefits. They move resources from the haves to the have-nots, minimizing inequality. Gift economies ensure neighbors take care of each other. People might face scarcity together occasionally, but nobody suffers poverty alone while others have abundance. Gift economies help people take care of each other whenever a big challenge arises.

In nations that expect everybody to stand for what's right, this is the way of life that results -- a life of shared abundance. As Okanagan woman Jeannette Armstrong said, "_The realization that people and community are there to sustain you creates the most secure feeling in the world..._"[xxx-original instructions|armstrong]

In nations that forbid people from seeking justice and upholding their own laws -- because that is supposedly the police's job -- profit economies result, with a few people becoming extremely wealthy, and the rest trying to survive and get as comfortable as possible in their unhealthy nation. Widespread selfishness is the result.

But it doesn't have to be this way. Individuals and whole nations are capable of incredible generosity when everyone stands for a culture of mutual respect, and nobody rules over anybody else.

<div class="rev-act-body">Everyone has an urge to stand for what's right, but many learn to hold back out of fear -- fear of losing friends, angering a spouse, losing their job, or getting punished.
