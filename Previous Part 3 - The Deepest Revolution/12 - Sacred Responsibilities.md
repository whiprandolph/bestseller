### Hopelessness - Why Bother?

"Why bother" -- biggest problem.

Study oppressed people for lessons in resilience.

When you feel alone, just finding one other person to speak your deepest feelings with might seem impossible. If you have 10, 100 might seem impossible. If you have 100, 10,000 might seem impossible. 

And that's good, because you already know everything needed to help create a healthy culture. But depending on your life path, some of it may have been forgotten. 



You are the giving of your sacred gifts. Giving your deepest love is what you're here to do, it's who you're here to be. And not alone either, but with others giving their love too.














The truth is that the Earth loves us -- you, me, everyone. But many people have learned not to notice, and not feel very grateful. 



The sun was setting one evening in 2015 as I sat with about 8-10 of my Ashaninkan hosts. Some of them had gone fishing in the nearby river earlier that day, and we were all passing around pieces of fish they'd caught. I had brought food with me when I first arrived a week earlier, but we had traveled away from my sleeping area, and I didn't have my food with me to share.

But it didn't matter -- they just shared their food like they did every night. I didn't have to give them any money or food, nor even promise to feed them later. They just shared, with a relaxed joyfulness that made eating together a simple pleasure every time.

Ever since they first welcomed me, I had felt this growing sense of gratitude because they had been so generous, and hadn't made any demands in return. They taught me how to spin cotton into yarn, invited me to sing and dance and consume ayahuasca with them, had shared their food and sleeping spaces with me. When I crossed a fast-flowing river up to my waist after a long hike, one man offered to take my pack across. There'd been so many moments where I felt grateful, but that night I felt it specially strongly, and I noticed an equally strong desire to give back to them somehow.

My friend Mike had invited me to join him in this visit to the Ashaninka, and he had told me about their generosity. Before we left the Peruvian town, he had said, "_Bring them gifts. They are such kind and generous people that no matter how many gifts you bring them, you will wish you had brought more._"

Mike was right. I felt so grateful, and I felt an equally strong desire to give back to them. A little later, when I finally shared my big sack of gifts, they seemed pleased with everything, but I still felt a twinge of sadness when the bag was empty, and I didn't have any more material goods left to give. I wished I had more gifts to share.

In later years, I realized that this deep desire to give back to them was an example of reciprocity, a core spiritual practice of healthy cultures. I didn't give them goods in trade, or out of a sense of obligation or need to prove myself. I did it because I noticed the gifts they gave me, and I felt grateful and wanted to give back to the people who gave me so much. (Their generosity and warmth affected me so deeply that I'm tearing up as I write this, almost 10 years later!)

In the following years, I made a big shift -- I started noticing nonhumans giving me gifts too. I noticed the chestnut trees giving gifts of chestnut, without demanding any pay or trade in return. I noticed the nearby stream giving me water for drinking and bathing, and birds who helped me learn to listen carefully. I received gifts of meat, bone broth, and hides from deer, and fire from cedar and basswood trees.

The more I noticed all the gifts I received, the more I wanted to give back -- to the birds and chestnut trees, to the streams and the deer. Just like I was grateful to the Ashaninka, and felt this desire to give back to the people who'd given so much to me, I felt the same desire to give back to the nonhumans who gave so much to me.

In her book _Braiding Sweetgrass_, Potawatomi woman Robin Kimmerer described the importance of this reciprocity: "Each person, human or no, is bound to every other in a reciprocal relationship. Just as all beings have a duty to me, I have a duty to them." If I receive meat from an animal, I am bound to support the animal's family or community. When I eat corn, I have a responsibility to take care of the soil it grows in. When I receive a river's gift of clear water, I am responsible for caring for the river. Kimmerer noted that learning and practicing these responsibilities is "an integral part of a human's education."[xxx-duplicate with spirituality chapter]

I believe living in reciprocity is a sacred responsibility, and really, it's who we are as human beings. No one had to force me to feel gratitude, or force me to give back to the people and nonhumans who gave to me. Indeed, someone would have had to force me _not_ to, the desire to give back was so strong.

These are the three core spiritual practices at play --

1. A practical, aware gratitude: Noticing the gifts of others, both people and nonhumans, and feeling grateful for them. 

2. Giving my gifts: giving my deepest love, or living out your life purpose. Other gifts may take the form of mentoring, personal qualities like joy or integrity, material gifts, or other things.

3. Living in reciprocity: giving back to the humans and nonhumans who give so much to you.

The big shift was to see myself as the Earth, not somehow different or separated -- another attitude I see in every healthy culture. Okanagan woman Jeannette Armstrong said, "it's not just that we're part of the land... but that the land is us." It's true -- each of us is a gift of the Earth, alive to receive the gifts of others and give our own gifts in reciprocity, each person in their own way.

### Children

* Some people become authoritarian parents, being very strict but using shame, physical abuse, etc. 

* Some people reject authoritarian upbringings, but have low or no standards or set boundaries poorly. 

### Commit to Personal Growth for Yourself and Others

Beautiful qualities really can be pervasive and normal, including authenticity, integrity, responsibility, thoughtfulness, bravery, joy, and generosity. Living a deeply meaningful life, in service of people you care about and who care about you -- this can be normal. For these qualities to be normal in a group of people, I believe they simply need to have high expectations for themselves, each person holding themselves and each other to a high standard of excellent behavior.

When cowardice, selfishness, and low integrity are pervasive, many people learn to have low expectations for each other. Plenty of people have learned never to trust anybody to speak the truth or "stick their neck out" for others.

Tragically, people's behavior changes dramatically after they become trapped in unhealthy cultures and fully submit to abusive authorities. Crow woman Pretty Shield described how the United States killed the buffalo that the Crow depended on, and after this the Crow had to either starve or submit to American law. She described the transformation the men went through when they finally submitted: "Our men had fought hard against our enemies, holding them back from our beautiful country by their bravery; but now, with everything else going wrong, we began to be whipped by weak foolishness... Our wise-ones became fools, and drank the white man's whisky. But what else was there for us to do? We knew no other way than to listen to our chiefs and head men. Our old men used to be different; even our children were different when the buffalo were here."

There is no room for masculine wisdom and bravery in an unhealthy culture that forbids peope from upholding their own laws and standing for what's right. Thus many men do not cultivate these qualities, and do not know what they are missing. This explains why so many women in unhealthy cultures wonder "where are all the good men?"

Sioux man Rain-In-The-Face man described how his spirit died when he submitted: "Rain-In-The-Face was killed when he put down his weapons before the Great Father [US president]. His spirit was gone then; only his poor body lived on..."

Rain-In-The-Face knew what it was like to live in a healthy culture that welcomed all his gifts, including his willingness to stand for what's right no matter what. Thus he knew that his spirit died when he submitted. But when people are born into an unhealthy culture, they are trained for submissive obedience from an early age, and many don't even recognize the deep impact this has on them -- on their spiritual strength, their authenticity, bravery, dignity, integrity, joy, and many other qualities.

These stories and many others showed me that widespread selfishness, low integrity, drunkenness, depression, superficiality, and other troubles are not inevitable. They are simply predictable consequences among people who have embraced submissive obedience, and who try to maximize their safety and comfort in an unhealthy culture.

_Merely living under rulers does not lead anybody to develop these terrible qualities_. The trouble comes when a person internally submits, embracing shame, low self-worth, self-doubt, selfishness, distraction, isolation, or other attitudes that allow them to avoid the dissatisfaction of giving less than their deepest love.

Thus, if you want to help form a healthy culture or healthy subculture, _commit to personal growth and lovingly hold yourself and others to a high standard of excellent behavior_. Avoid shame, condescension, and hurtful assumptions, and also learn not to accept less than full integrity, authenticity, wisdom, and other beautiful qualities.

I also urge you to either join or start a group of people committed to each other's personal growth. Releasing shame and self-doubt is very hard alone, or even impossible. In contrast, personal growth can be fun with other trusted people that are all committed to bringing out the best in each other and living a joyful, meaningful, and intentional life.

Cowardice, foolishness, low awareness, and other hurtful qualities prevent a person from having the strength to stand for what's right. A person who embraces these cannot be part of a healthy culture. Qualities like bravery, wisdom, gratitude, awareness, generosity, joy, and others form the spiritual foundation needed to participate in a healthy culture.

I am not asking anyone to "be perfect." I ask you to commit to being your best self, learning as much as possible from your mistakes, walking a meaningful path in life, and consistently facing your fears. Hold yourself and others to a high standard, and become friends with people that also hold themselves and others to a high standard.

In this way, caring people can bring out the best in each other, and build that spiritual foundation upon which a healthy culture might someday form.

### Cultivate Deep Awareness

* nature connection -> human connection

* practice feeling gratitude - notice the gifts of life, and practice feeling grateful

* from that gratitude, consider - how can you serve the beings you feel grateful for?

* avoid hurtful assumptions. Ignorance can be ok temporarily, but believing hurtful and false things can really damage relationships.

* your attention is one of the most precious and powerful things you have. Do you pay attention to your surroundings, or are you in your head or on your phone? Do you pay attention to your feelings or avoid them? Do you distract yourself from a meaningless life with televised sports, social media, alcohol, and drugs? Or do you seek meaningful relationships, cultivate meaningful skills, and deeply enjoy life? Do you hide from your fears, or do you face them?

Notice where you put your attention, and where you don't. Your attention is always _somewhere_. I'm simply suggesting that you cultivate awareness like any other crucial life skill, one that can transform your life and relationships, and help you generate a healthy culture if you choose.

How can you feel grateful if you don't notice all the gifts you receive?



Of course deep awareness isn't cultivated in unhealthy cultures; people lulled into lazy thinking and foolish assumptions are easy to manipulate.

### Create a Healthy Subculture

* People you can speak your heart to. Might disagree on some things, but committed to each other's wellbeing and personal growth.

* Embrace healthy culture practices -- share generously, stand up for each other if anyone's attacked or hurt or lost their job, mentor each other's children, be honest in your words and authentic with your feelings, etc.



Everyone knows that a

### Generate Abundance and Share It

* I wish guns and drones didn't exist, but since they do, I will use them in service. 

* The problem isn't making money -- the problem is selfishly hoarding it. Visitors to the Tzutujil Mayans and Huron noticed they loved accumulating food so they could throw huge feasts and give it all away. There is no virtue in poverty. As Don Cox said, "Use what you got to get what you need." Generate abundance however you can, and do excellent things with it. 


In economies based on exploitation, it is sadly difficult to make money without participating in exploitation somehow, just as it's difficult to find transportation that does not pollute, or houses made without toxins.

Once again, I look to the Zapatistas and Black Panthers for inspiration. They didn't necessarily stop working normal jobs while they sought deep change; they just knew that each person individually "getting a better job" in an exploitative economy was not the path to collective freedom.


### Live in Reciprocity as a Normal Way of Life

* [xxx-NEED: add "the Earth loves you back" -- love is not just one way]

I never knew how intimately people could know the Earth and even enrich the Earth as a normal way of life till I studied healthy cultures, where people embrace these three core spiritual practices as a normal way of life.

The Apache man Stalking Wolf described how he looked for a tree to make a bow, and he did this in a way that benefitted the whole forest. Guided more by his heart than his mind, he might spend days looking for just the right sapling -- often one in the middle of a thick grove. He verified that removing that particular tree would benefit the grove, and it would also yield a strong bow. After all, the tall straight saplings which had received plenty of sun had had an easy life, and made weak bows. The trees that struggled to survive and reach the sun developed tight growth rings, leading to a bow that could generate much more power. After offering a prayer and receiving permission from Creator, he harvested the bow, knowing the harvest would serve both his people and the forest.

Robin Kimmerer described how Potawatomi people benefit the black ash trees they use to make baskets. Traditional tree harvesters recognize each tree as an individual, nonhuman person. A respectful harvest begins with a request. The tree cutter describes their purpose and asks the tree for permission to be harvested and listens carefully for a response, which is sometimes no. Perhaps something in the surroundings, such as a bird's nest or close neighbor explains why the tree declined to be harvested, or perhaps the person just knows. Either way, the respectful harvester keeps asking trees until they hear a yes. Then they offer a prayer and gift of tobacco before cutting down the tree with great care not to damage its trunk or tree neighbors.

Black ash tree population had been declining in their region in New York State, but when Kimmerer and an assistant investigated, they found that the decline wasn't even across the tree's range -- in some areas the population was increasing, and some areas it was decreasing, and they found that black ashes were actually thriving wherever there were traditional Potawatomi basket makers. Black ash trees need open space in the canopy to thrive; saplings die in full shade. Basket makers opened up the canopy occasionally as they harvested black ash. Where the basket makers no longer harvested, the canopy remained closed and black ash numbers declined.

Humans thus benefited from the black ash, and the black ash benefited from humans. New generations of black ash thrived wherever people respectfully harvested it.

Even hunting relationships can be mutually respectful. A nomadic Mongolian named Bilgee explained to a young Chinese man how his people had respectful relationships with animals they hunted. The wolves sometimes ate the Mongolians' sheep, but they also ate gazelles that eat the same grass as the sheep.
Bilgee said, "Gazelles are a scourge on the grassland... they... eat all the time." He sometimes hunted wolves, but not often, saying, "If we killed them off, the grassland would perish, and then how would we survive?"

Bilgee even said his people don't use wolf pelts as bedding, even though they are far superior to sheep pelts, saying, "We respect the wolves too much... Tengger [God] is the father, the grassland is the mother, and the wolves kill only animals that harm the grassland. How could Tengger not bestow its favors on wolves?"

People living in this way can generate tremendous wild abundance. In their book _A Basic Call to Consciousness_, Haudenosaunee writers described how, when they were able to live in a fully traditional way, taking only what they needed and practicing strict conservation, they lived with "almost unimaginable abundance and variety of nuts, berries, roots, and herbs. In addition to these, the rivers teemed with fish and the forest and its meadows abounded with game..."

This is simply a gift economy in action, where people do not just share generously amongst themselves within their culture, but actively serve the nonhumans around them. The Mohawk writers noted, "ours is a Way of Life, and... our economy cannot be separated from the many aspects of our culture." I believe this is because they do not just share among each other while selfishly taking from the nonhumans. That practice of living in reciprocity doesn't just exist between people, but it's a responsibility towards nonhumans as well.

Stories like these showed me how humans can sustain themselves while serving or enriching the nonhuman life around them. It's not magic, or something only certain people of certain cultures can do. These practices are core to who we are as humans; they're part of each one of us, and they're universal in societies where rulers don't manipulate the lives of everyone else. This is why Cherokee woman Rebecca Adamson said, "tribal people worship the sacredness of creation as a way of life, not as a philosophy or religion."

In unhealthy cultures, a few people force laws on the rest, then punish them for standing for what's right. No wonder it is difficult to live in a good way, where people maintain respect relations within the culture, and between the people and the Earth.

But anyone can practice living in a reciprocal way with the Earth. One simple way is to plant a garden, and tend it in a way that the soil is richer than it would have been if you had planted. I have one organic farmer friend who began farming on bare clay and carefully enriched the soil with careful observation and practices like making biochar, minimal-till, composting his neighbors' poop and urine, bringing in compost from grocery stores in town, and much more. He has added so many more nutrients to the Earth than he's taken through harvest that he's added 13 inches of topsoil -- very different than the field of clay he started with!

Growing up in an unhealthy culture made it hard for me to find these three core spiritual practices. I didn't grow up practicing gratitude as a way of life or receiving the gifts of the Earth, and I didn't grow up practicing deep awareness so that I could see all the gifts I had been receiving without even noticing it. I didn't grow up learning to feel equally grateful for the gifts of nonhumans and humans, and feeling an equally strong desire to give back.

But I have good news: all these perspectives can be practiced. And it turns out, cultivating deep awareness doesn't just help people relate to nonhumans better -- awareness helps people relate to each other better, too.

### Sacred Responsibilities

For millennia, unhealthy cultures have been spreading, and they encourage and reward people for taking without giving back -- whether by keeping people financially dependent and desperate for money, punishing people for standing for what's right, instilling deep childhood shame, or a thousand other ways.

But the truth remains: living in reciprocity with other people and the Earth is a sacred responsibility. Other sacred responsibilities enable that reciprocity: Cultivating deep awareness and gratitude for the gifts of life, each person cultivating their own sacred gifts and learning how to give their deepest love, learning the practical skills to meaningfully serve other people and the Earth, and more. I believe that embracing these responsibilities is essential for any group that wanted to create a new healthy culture.

There is another sacred responsibility: cultivating the spiritual strength to stand for what's right, without any compensation, even at great personal risk. To explore how to cultivate this strength, join me in _Chapter 13: Integrity and Bravery_.
