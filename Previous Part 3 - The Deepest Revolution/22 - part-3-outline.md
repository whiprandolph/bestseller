### Chapter W

#### The Moment When Everything Changes

#### Imagine...

l
The "Bibliography" section in this book offers a key list of writings on which this book is based, and _one Disease One Cure_ offers many more.

#### Find People To Whom You Can Speak Your Heart

* ref mom's story - I know someone who, in the early 1990s, thought about whether it was ok for the US to invade Iraq. She wondered, is the US invading to bring democracy? Or take oil? Is it ok to kill people to take oil?

Unfortunately, she was the wife of a US military officer living on an overseas base, surrounded by soldiers and their spouses. She was unable to find other people to share her concerns with, and speak her heart. She was surrounded by people, but unable to discuss what mattered to her and consider how to respond with others.

Over time, she became more stressed, and she and her husband began speaking of divorce. She had the career and family of her dreams but was deeply unhappy. Finally, she decided to take anti-depressants, which allowed her to numb the feeling of dissatisfaction without responding to it. She stopped thinking deeply about politics.

Plenty of people who feel trapped and unable to respond to their fears cope by numbing their feelings with endless distractions, whether through screen addiction, drugs, overworking, or other ways. These are simply ways people learn to "hold back" or "shut down" parts of themselves to avoid feeling their own dissatisfaction when they don't see a way to respond productively.

The most important step to addressing any concerns or fears you have is this: find other people you trust to tell them how you feel and your concerns and thoughts, and listen to them too. If you don't trust anyone in your life this much, then make new friends.

* This showed me the importance of finding someone you can speak your heart to. Either deepen the friendships you have, or make new friends.

* find people. Start with 1 if you need to, then find another after that.

### Chapter X: Embrace the 3 Core Spiritual Practices

In school, I was constantly learning new things, often at a superficial level. This is not a good model for learning life lessons -- because the truth is, there aren't that many really important life lessons to learn.

Instead, if you're wise, you figure out the fundamentals and you just keep practicing, growing a deeper wisdom and brighter love every day.

* already saw how _practical, aware gratitude_ can help people choose good leaders: when you recognize others' good deeds and feel grateful, all that's left is to spread the word. Your people will find good leaders.

* how else could practical, aware gratitude help turn a group of strangers into a tightknit community?

#### 1st Core Spiritual Practice: A Practical, Aware Gratitude

##### Cultivate Deep Awareness Through Nature Connection

* nature connection -> empathy

##### To Feel Grateful for the Earth, Learn to Receive Its Gifts

##### Everything is a Gift - Including Your Dissatisfaction

#### 2nd Core Spiritual Practice: Cultivate and Give Your Sacred Gifts

* you are the giving of your love

#### 3rd Core Spiritual Practice: Live in Reciprocity

* imagine unforced indebtedness...

* Earth loves you back

* garden to start reciprocal relationship with Earth. If you don't own land and can't get permission, then I recommend guerilla gardening which is a style of gardening where you don't ask permission.

Many people focus on making their garden as orderly as possible. Instead, I suggest you maximize abundance. How rich can you make your soil? How much insect life can you attract, including the predator-insects that eat the insects that eat your vegetables? How can you attract the most pollinators and birds?

In other words, how can you best feed the land and nonhumans around you, creating abundance for all?

#### Dignity and Self-Respect: Give Your Gifts Even in the Face of Hopelessness

* People treat their living spaces like they treat themselves. 

* Practice not only cleaning up after yourself, but cleaning up after other people. When I visit my sit spot each day, there is always new trash, and I always pick up some and put it in the bin. I know it doesn't reduce the amount of trash in the world, but just moves it out of my area. And I know there will be more trash tomorrow, so I know I can't make it permanently clean. But leaving the world more beautiful and more excellent than I found it is who I am -- and it's who you are too.

Even if things seem hopeless, with huge environmental troubles, imperialism, and oppression, you can still move through the world with dignity and self-respect, offering your gifts.

Black Elk showed me how to have this kind of bravery, to give my deepest love even when things look bleak. He and other Lakota expected to die once after being captured by the Americans. They dressed for death and began singing death songs as they wished to end life bravely even if they could not escape. He said, "if it was the end of our lives and we could do nothing, we wanted to die brave. We could not fight this that was going to kill us, but we could die so that our spirit relatives would not be ashamed of us."

Humans may well go extinct soon -- or maybe not. Nuclear war, climate change, and the spread of chemical toxins all can seem overwhelming and inevitable. 

But the truth is that many people have struggled with despair and depression for millennia. William Wallace said, "Every man dies. Not every man truly lives."

### Chapter Y: Cultivate Integrity and Bravery

#### Cultivate Integrity

#### Cultivate Bravery

* many think of bravery as fearlessly facing danger, but that's a limiting perspective.

I think of bravery this way: _A person showing bravery remains fully conscious and acts in service of what matters under any challenge._

In other words, a brave person "does what's right" or "does the right thing" no matter what -- even at great personal risk.

##### Nothing Will Save Us From Ourselves
* No economic system, no governance system

##### Protect Each Other

* Standing up for one's self and others is the ultimate act of self-respect. The fact that so many people tolerate so much abuse indicates how little self-respect there is in unhealthy cultures. 

#### Commit to Personal Growth with Others

* Hold yourself and others to a high standard of excellent behavior. Of course no one's perfect, and many people have plenty of shame, low self-worth, and other qualities to grow out of. So long as people remain committed to being their best selves, acknowledging and learning from each mistake, they will walk a good path.

* having high expectations brings out the best in others -- people often rise or fall to the standards set for them. So if your friends ever tolerate less than your best, remind them you expect better from them.

* practice making promises to yourself and practice keeping them. When you sometimes break those promises, practice not feeling shame, but figuring out what lessons to learn so you can show up better in the future.

* If you do not have such friends, go make new friends. They will be glad to know you. 

#### Your Integrity is the Structure of your Culture

* Anyone can make agreements. What brings those agreements to life is upholding them. Having agreements and upholding them is what turns a collection of people into a community or a nation.

* Bravery -- do the right thing no matter what (see opening quotes in sacred masc chapter)

* Cultivate integrity by a simple 5 step process:

1. *Commit:* Hold yourself to a standard of complete integrity: telling the truth, keeping your promises, and acting in service of what matters to you.

2. *Notice:* Notice when you're out of integrity -- when you don't tell the truth, or you're late to a meeting, or you act selfishly somehow.

3. *Release shame:*: Don't feel shame. If you notice yourself feeling shame, let that go. Remind yourself that you're not bad; you just made a mistake and you can grow from it. Releasing any shame is extremely important.

4. *Decide:* Decide what lessons to learn from your mistakes. Why did you not show up with integrity? What could help you show up better next time?

5. *Recommit:* Commit to living fully in integrity again.

### Chapter Z: More Character Things?

#### Accept Deep Responsibility -- Don't Fear It

* Life and death decisions

#### Dream Big and Take Risks

#### Become Comfortable with Uncertainty

#### Create a Healthy Subculture

Already explored some practices:

* generous sharing

* celebrate good deeds

* practice noticing the gifts you receive, and practice feeling grateful

* etc..

Of course, generosity and selfishness don't mix well. Either help the people in your group feel comfortable sharing and taking care of each other, or evict them till they're ready to share.

What practices could help you cultivate a deep awareness? And 

#### Create a New Healthy Culture -- That is, Create a New Nation

#### How Much Do You Want Freedom?

Imagine living with such abundance that parents could commonly give their child+spouse a fully outfitted home when they married...

#### The Deepest Revolution

I have my blindspots, and I continue to learn every day. But there are a few things I know beyond any doubt.

Some people say the arc of history bends towards justice. I say the arc of history bends whichever way people bend it.

Ultimately, we remain in an abusive culture because we tolerate it. Yes, there has been a massive amount of shame, violence, broken promises, lies, and spiritual wounding that make deep change really hard. Rulers and their servants use so many tricks and traps to get us to continue to tolerate our own abuse, to accept our own humiliating submissiveness as legitimate and "just the way life is."

I believe the only way to end abuse is to stop tolerating it. That's what deep revolution is: when enough people take a stand together and take care of each other even at great personal risk in order to create a new way of life. The arc of history bends when enough people choose to give their divine love fully, right now, rather than holding back in hopes of avoiding abuse for another day.

The night before his assassination, Martin Luther King Jr said, "I've seen the promised land. I may not get there with you. But I want you to know tonight, that we, as a people, will get to the promised land."[xxx-mlk final speech afscmd]

I'm telling you I've BEEN to the promised land. I've lived with a whole healthy culture where people routinely have integrity, generosity, respect for men, women and children, deep connection with the Earth, strong leaders, and no rulers.

The promised land is real, and I'll tell you what else I learned -- _**WE are the promised land**_. Every single person can be one of our messiahs, one of our liberators as we free ourselves from the biggest trap in human history. And the more messiahs, the more liberators, the better. _Living with rulers is a catastrophe. Now is the time to end it._

As Jesus Christ, Harriet Tubman, and other spiritual leaders around the world have proven, this is no easy path. Never has been. But now is the time. People are suffering as prison slaves. Pollution is causing all manner of diseases and destruction. Racism and sexism persist. Genocides and hate continue, as do the wars that kill the poor and profit the rich. Nonhumans are dying in large numbers. And nuclear apocalypse threatens all of us.

Kings and billionaires of unhealthy cultures threaten, bribe, trick, and trap countless people to support all these terrible things and more. I believe the only solution is to create new healthy cultures -- new nations, where everybody bravely stands for what's right as a normal way of life.

I don't know how to achieve the transformation I want, but I know where I stand. I stand with the Earth, and I stand for a culture of mutual respect. And I'm not the only one.

Millions of people are standing for the Earth and standing for cultures of mutual respect right now. Some of us were born into healthy cultures, and some of us were born into unhealthy cultures. In countless different ways, all around the world, we are taking this stand together.

And I'd love for you to join us.
