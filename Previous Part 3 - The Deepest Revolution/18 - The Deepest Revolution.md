## Chapter 18: The Deepest Revolution

* Until now, I have only included revolutionary activities that I have embraced in my life. But I have never worked with others to found a nation, so I do not know how everything that is required. But I know the work needs to be done even if I don't know all the steps.

* Study healthy nations, become friends with people who carry their healthy-culture traditions. Healthy nations have found a huge variety of ways of sharing food, choosing servant-leaders, having sexual relationships, eating nutritious diets, raising strong children, living in harmony with the Earth, addressing inappropriate behavior, responding to threats, and more. Consider which ways could work for you, and which wouldn't, and what lessons to learn.

### The Deepest Revolution and Creating a New Healthy Culture are the Same Path

A revolution is just a process, usually violent, where people in power lose that power. In a shallow revolution, oa new ruling class replaces the old, and the lives of most people don't change much.

After the Deepest Revolution, there is no ruling class. The people seize power together, and collectively stand for a culture of mutual respect. They appoint wise and generous leaders and replace them as needed so their leaders always serve the people.

What is the path to that Deepest Revolution? Sadly I have not experienced this myself. For those of us who have forgotten our healthy-culture ancestors, I believe that path to the Deepest Revolution and the path to creating a new healthy nation, or a new nation, are one and the same path. 

Recall that freedom simply means living in a society where everyone expects everyone else to bravely uphold their laws and seek justice. To live in a free society, everyone has to have that spiritual strength to give their deepest love and continuously stand for what's right.

Every revolutionary activity in this book encourages aspects of that spiritual strength. I believe that the attitudes, relationships, and practices from these activities are universal in healthy nations. In other words, if you apply yourself and embrace these activities as a normal way of life, they will prepare you to play a good role in that Deepest Revolution.

Consider the key revolutionary activities from this book: embracing the three core spiritual gratitudes (practical aware gratitude, giving your sacred gifts, and living in reciprocity), deep awareness and empathy, praising others' good deeds, channeling anger in productive ways, savoring the joy of giving without any expectation of return, standing for what's right and supporting others when they take this stand, cultivating a mutually enriching relationship with the Earth, noticing and questioning your own assumptions, practicing integrity and bravery, being part of a group where people share and hold each other to high standards of excellent behavior, physical training, self-defense training, protecting the Earth: I believe all these practices can prepare anybody to play a strong role in a healthy nation.

And when you work with others to form groups that share, hold each other to high standards and embrace these other revolutionary practices, you form _healthy subcultures_. You may still be stuck in an unhealthy nation, living under others' laws. But when you and others in your group hold each other to a high standard, effectively creating your own standards of good behavior -- that is, you'll be creating your own unwritten laws.

The Haudenosaunee writers said their culture "was founded on concepts of moral justice, not statute law." Instead of endlessly debating legal minutiae, I believe they focused on building up everybody's spiritual strength, each person holding the others to a high standard and expecting the best from each other, and helping each other grow. When everyone has the spiritual strength to stand for what's right, a culture of mutual respect results.

You and the people around you could start on this path now, even while trapped in an unhealthy nation. Build your spiritual strength, and hold yourself and others to high standards, and you'll begin forming a healthy subculture.

Every little healthy subculture of 5 or 10 people can form the seed of fully soverign healthy subculture someday in the future....



### Found a New Nation with Others

* not a small thing or easy. But it's the one political project where, if you succeeded, could make the deepest, most transformational difference.

* in an unhealthy nation, real victories are rare and every victory is temporary: abortion "rights" can be given, then taken away again. Racist hiring can be outlawed in one administration, then encouraged again in the next. One political party might protect a forest, and then another comes to power and allows it to be logged.

Why? Because there are very wealthy, political powerful people who are very selfish and who benefit from racism -- like there are powerful people who benefit from sexism, environmental destruction, corruption, deceitful media, and so on. Corrupt people never want their self-serving activities to come to light, so they always want to distract, divide, gaslight, deceive, and otherwise manipulate.

And when people are trapped in financial desperation, they will do whatever's necessary to survive -- and if that means logging, printing falsehoods in a newspaper, or other hurtful things, so be it. When there's no solidarity, and no one holding each other to high standards of behavior, financially desperate people will do what they need to survive, and play whatever mental and emotional games they need to to protect their survival.

So, if you wanted to protect a river, what is the best way? Found a new nation that embraces reciprocity, each person with the others and the Earth. When everyone stands for what's right and shares as a way of life, you won't have financially desperate poor people doing whatever it takes to survive. You won't have rich people constantly corrupting your leadership to enact policies that make them richer.

This is why the Zapatistas outlawed hoarding wealth, and redistributed excess wealth as part of their revolution. They did not allow corruption in their society -- none. Because corruption and selfishness are the same, that means they got rid of selfishness, encouraging a society of generosity instead.

Life will always be full of challenges, especially in a world with so many unhealthy nations. Even if a group of a million people successfully founded a new nation and could protect themselves from nearby unhealthy nations, life would not suddenly become problem-free. But so long as they maintain a healthy nation where everyone stands for what's right, certain types of problems can actually go away -- discrimination, greed, and so on.

And that means that people can make agreements that last generations, or as long as this new nation lasts, and not just until the next political administration comes to office. Your nation could agree never to pollute the water of a river nearby, and you wouldn't have to worry about unaccountable political leaders and corrupt businessmen changing that policy in 2 years.

In this way, in your own nation, you wouldn't keep fighting the same political fights like people do endlessly in unhealthy nations. That's because when you found a new, healthy nation, you no longer have the greed and corruption at the heart of your society.

### Hold Each Other to a High Standard

* You can't control what others do, but you can control yourself. And you can have high expectations for others.

* People noticed big shift after being conquered/forced into unhealthy nations (Pretty Shield, Rain-in-the-Face quotes, reference health issues from Price, or notice how shocked people like me or liedloff were at relaxed joyfulness)

* in practice, when people hold each other to a high standard of excellent behavior -- including things like generosity, awareness, integrity, authenticity, joy, and walking a meaningful path in life -- they are also building up each other's dignity and self-respect.

Dignified, self-respecting people hold themselves to a high standard of excellent and beautiful behavior. And when they make a mistake, instead of feeling shame, they learn whatever lesson is needed so they can hold themselves to that high standard.





### Accept Deep Responsibility -- Don't Fear It

* Life and death decisions

* Or perhaps you like your little role studying corruption in your area of interest, like toxins in food, politicians being bribed, revolving doors between government and business, or unfair criminal "justice" systems. 

### Dream Big and Take Risks

### Become Comfortable with Uncertainty


### Create a Healthy Subculture

Already explored some practices:

* generous sharing

* celebrate good deeds

* practice noticing the gifts you receive, and practice feeling grateful

* etc..

Of course, generosity and selfishness don't mix well. Either help the people in your group feel comfortable sharing and taking care of each other, or evict them till they're ready to share.

What practices could help you cultivate a deep awareness? And 

### Create a New Healthy Culture -- That is, Create a New Nation

### How Much Do You Want Freedom?

Imagine living with such abundance that parents could commonly give their child+spouse a fully outfitted home when they married...




### Nothing Will Save Us From Ourselves
* No economic system, no governance system

### The Deepest Revolution

I have my blindspots, and I continue to learn every day. But there are a few things I know beyond any doubt.

Some people say the arc of history bends towards justice. I say the arc of history bends whichever way people bend it.

Ultimately, we remain in an abusive culture because we tolerate it. Yes, there has been a massive amount of shame, violence, broken promises, lies, and spiritual wounding that make deep change really hard. Rulers and their servants use so many tricks and traps to get us to continue to tolerate our own abuse, to accept our own humiliating submissiveness as legitimate and "just the way life is."

I believe the only way to end abuse is to stop tolerating it. That's what deep revolution is: when enough people take a stand together and take care of each other even at great personal risk in order to create a new way of life. The arc of history bends when enough people choose to give their divine love fully, right now, rather than holding back in hopes of avoiding abuse for another day.

The night before his assassination, Martin Luther King Jr said, "I've seen the promised land. I may not get there with you. But I want you to know tonight, that we, as a people, will get to the promised land."[xxx-mlk final speech afscmd]

I'm telling you I've BEEN to the promised land. I've lived with a whole healthy nation where people routinely have integrity, generosity, respect for men, women and children, deep connection with the Earth, strong leaders, and no rulers.

The promised land is real, and I'll tell you what else I learned -- _**WE are the promised land**_. Every single person can be one of our messiahs, one of our liberators as we free ourselves from the biggest trap in human history. And the more messiahs, the more liberators, the better. _Living with rulers is a catastrophe. Now is the time to end it._

As Jesus Christ, Harriet Tubman, and other spiritual leaders around the world have proven, this is no easy path. Never has been. But now is the time. People are suffering as prison slaves. Pollution is causing all manner of diseases and destruction. Racism and sexism persist. Genocides and hate continue, as do the wars that kill the poor and profit the rich. Nonhumans are dying in large numbers. And nuclear apocalypse threatens all of us.

Kings and billionaires of unhealthy nations threaten, bribe, trick, and trap countless people to support all these terrible things and more. I believe the only solution is to create new healthy nations -- new nations, where everybody bravely stands for what's right as a normal way of life.

I don't know how to achieve the transformation I want, but I know where I stand. I stand with the Earth, and I stand for a culture of mutual respect. And I'm not the only one.

Millions of people are standing for the Earth and standing for cultures of mutual respect right now. Some of us were born into healthy nations, and some of us were born into unhealthy nations. In countless different ways, all around the world, we are taking this stand together.

And I'd love for you to join us.
