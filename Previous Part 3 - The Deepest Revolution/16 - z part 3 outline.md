## 14. The Biggest Secret in Human History

### Explain the secret - and now you know it

### Imagine

### Keep the vision alive

## 15. The Deepest Revolution, Part 1: Cultivate Your Spiritual Strength

* both individual and collective responsibility. It starts with each person individually and expands to create relationships that promote revolutionary healthy subcultures that eventually transform whole nations. 

### Difference between average people of healthy/unhealthy -- they have high standards

What is the key difference between average people of healthy/unhealthy? People in healthy cultures, past and present, hold themselves to high standards

### How high can our standards be?

* examples of widespread integrity, physical resilience, meaningful education, benefitting the Earth

* sacred masc and fem very briefly referenced, as examples of high standards and what's possible

### When People are discouraged from developing high standards and are rewarded for low standards, the outcome is dismal

* people having low expectations/standards for themselves/others is key symptom of unhealthy cultures

### How to Cultivate Your Spiritual Strength, Regardless Your Unhealthy Culture

* Review of revolutionary activities, show how they build spiritual strength, help you have high standards for yourself and others

* spiritual strength is foundation for freedom and relating to Earth+others in a good way (recap the perspective from Chapter 5)

## 16. The Deepest Revolution, Part 2: Build Healthy Subcultures by Holding Yourself and Others to High Standards

### Find like-minded people on a similar path
* Where to find them
* How to befriend them 
* Expect challenges and grow beyond them by holding yourself and others to high standards

### High Standards: Our Only Way to Collectively Be Who We Really Are
* No healthy culture is possible without high standards
* No hope of defeating powerful rulers without high standards
* The deepest revolution requires integrity

### Integrity and Natural Law

* integrity as structure in psychology, engineering -- and healthy cultures

* everyone's collective integrity is the structure of a healthy culture -- the source of law when no one imposes law on anyone else

### Everything is a Skill

* integrity, bravery, awareness, gratitude -- all these can be practiced like any other skill. So practice them, and help others practice to bring out the best in each other

* Bravery: quick definition, practice being in scary & uncomfortable situations and doing the right thing

  * Training children (or anybody) for obedience trains them for cowardice. 

* Integrity: 
    * complement of "trust", meaning there's a kind of integrity for every way that people want to trust each other: honesty, promise-keeping, integrity of service
    * practice honesty, keeping your promises, and acting in service instead of focusing just on oneself

### Build Revolutionary Healthy Subcultures by Holding Yourself and Others to High Standards

* commit to personal growth and collective growth with others

* people live up or down to expectations set for them

* your gifts matter more when you have others to give them to -- people who are grateful and who expect nothing less

* expectations you set become the law you live by -- ie the standards of behavior you expect from yourself and others

### Treat Children Respectfully

* Apache man Geronimo said, “When I was about eight or ten years old I began to follow the chase, and to me this was never work.”32 Ohiyesa wrote, “I hardly think I was ever tired in my life until those first days of boarding-school.”33 Ohiyesa also noted, “The Indian boy enjoyed such a life as almost all boys dream of and would choose for themselves if they were permitted to do so.”

* One very challenging aspect of finding freedom: adults who were raised to be obedient must learn to raise children to take deep responsibility for themselves and others without submissive obedience. Having high expectations of them for whatever stage of growth they are in.

### Give to the Earth Together

* Can serve the Earth either by enriching it (ie planting trees, tending the soil) or protecting it from further destruction

* one way or another, as a group, serve the Earth where you live. Cultivate a sense of place and gratitude for the specific gifts all around you.

### When People Have High Expectations for Themselves and Each Other, What Kind of Culture Will They Create?

* all the beautiful things -- awareness of each other and Earth, integrity, generosity, mutual respect -- all the qualities of healthy cultures. Just lacking freedom... hmm...

* still big problems -- but people would figure it out.

  * could study other healthy cultures -- how do they pick leaders? How do they maintain culture of generous sharing over time?

  * and trust in your own ability to make mistakes and learn from them

  * commit before you know the path, and embrace uncertainty

  * Deepest Revolution never ends, because people will always be standing for what's right as needed - continual humility

## 18. The Deepest Revolution: Returning to Who We Really Are

### Give Your Sacred Gifts

* As you recognize your sacred gifts and build your spiritual strength, you'll start feeling an urge to give those gifts. Will you find a way to raise & educate children in respectful ways -- unconditional love while holding them to a high standard? Or protect the Earth where you live? Study healthy cultures so you have more models for good ways to live? Or host training camps to prepare for the Deepest Revolution?

### We Only Have One Political Problem, and There's Only One Solution

* Racism, sexism, greed, privilege, corruption, pollution, poverty in the midst of abundance -- all these troubles exist in any society where people can't choose their own laws, nor uphold them.

* But all the different political problems boil down to one: we're not free. We're punished for doing the right thing and standing for what's right. As long as we ignore that root cultural disease, all these other cultural symptoms will continue endlessly. So the solution to all these troubles is to have the Deepest Revolution and create new healthy nations where people agree on their laws and expect everybody to uphold them, taking the people's and Earth's needs into account.

### The Deepest Revolution

* Something inspirational that hasn't come yet. Spiritual Strength together with other people and the Earth.
