## they remember life when everyone held each other to high standards

Even if the oppressive poverty, government schools, land theft, child kidnapping, and other troubles have made it difficult, they carry a memory of how to live properly with each other and the Earth. That means that if there is ever an opportunity for a successful Deep Revolution, people of healthy cultures are most likely to succeed, as they carry that cultural memory of how to live in a good way. The Zapatistas showed that people can pass this memory down for 500 years so that when it's time for revolution, that wisdom is available and the people are ready.

But if you're like me, you don't know anything about your healthy-culture ancestors. For me, some time in the distant past, my ancestors stopped passing down that ancient wisdom as they adjusted to life in their unhealthy culture.

### Spiritual strength scratch

### Scratch


All of creation is simply divine beings giving and receiving gifts. Yes, many humans act with cruelty and selfishness, and living in an unhealthy culture can make it difficult to see life in this beautiful way. But even the cruelty and selfishness have something to teach, something to feel grateful for -- they show me that people in my unhealthy culture are collectively not on a good path, and that motivates me to help makes things right.

Even acknowledging all the troubles in the world, it's still true that creation is simply divine beings giving and receiving gifts. And that means that the way for you to fit into creation -- the most meaningful way for you to approach life -- is to cultivate and give your sacred gifts too.

In other words, discover what you deeply care about, and how best to act in service of it. What is the most meaningful path you can walk in life?

There is a divine voice in your heart right now that knows this purpose already, or that knows your sacred gifts. If you don't already clearly know it, it's only because you've learned not to listen.

I didn't listen to that voice in my heart for many years, and when I first wondered about my gifts, I felt nervous or anxious. When I asked friends about theirs, many of them responded the same way. After years of school and jobs that train people to follow others' directions and rules, many people learn to ignore that inner voice that would guide them on a meaningful path if only they would listen.

If you're not walking that most meaningful path right now, then how do you know anything that you're doing matters? It's easy in unhealthy cultures to go into "survival mode" and focus on getting or keeping a job, and maintaining your mental and physical health. And certainly survival is important.

But you will only drift through life, waiting for life to matter, if you're not intentionally walking a meaningful path. Countless people ignore this to their detriment.

Maybe you set endless goals or make many commitments, keeping some and breaking others. But if you're not walking a meaningful path, then why do your goals or promises matter? Why does it matter if you have integrity or bravery if life itself feels meaningless, because you're not walking a meaningful path?

Some people feel passionate about an abstraction like scientific research or engineering. But if you just enjoy the tasks while you follow your employer's orders and don't much think about the real-world consequences of your work, how meaningful is your path really? Being a cog in someone else's machine is not meaningful.





I cannot tell you what your sacred gifts are, but I can offer some exercises that have helped me and other people understand their gifts.

* _Time Alone in the Wilderness Seeking Guidance_: 

* _Notice What Brings You Special Joy or Sparks Curiosity_:



* _Feel Your Anger_:


So what are your gifts? If you're totally clear, and if you're already giving your love fully, then good. But most people I encounter do not know their sacred gifts. 






* What cause or people or nonhumans do you care about? 

* If you've always known, but maybe not noticed or acted on it - feel that energy or curiosity

* What do you have to give? And to whom do you feel excited to give it?

* Partly this is about knowing yourself: maybe you have a strong urge to express yourself through dance, or research the cure for a disease that you've seen hurt people you love, or protecting a forest or river, or ending poverty where you live.

And partly this is about forming deep relationships with others. 

* many people struggle to feel passionate about anything. Others become passionate about cultivating certain skills, like scientific research or engineering, divorced from how they're ordered to use those skills by their bosses. Or become passionate about being the best in some sport or business, or art, or making the most money. Or they become passionate about some hobby or following professional sports.

In a sense, these are fine, but they're all essentially



### Cultivating Spiritual Strength, Part 3: Live in Reciprocity





















I think of spiritual strength as giving your deepest love and standing for what's right in any moment.

It may sound abstract or aspirational, but really it's just what people expect of each other.









A person with spiritual strength gives their deepest love and stands for what's right in each moment.

Writing about "spiritual strength" can make it seem abstract or unattainable, but it's actually just what people expect of each other.

Part of cultivating that spiritual strength involves cultivating deep relationships with other people and the Earth so that you care enough to serve them.

Do you have relationships with other people whom you trust, who you feel so grateful for that you actively look for ways to give back to them? Do you have any relationships with nonhumans like this, where you feel so grateful for them that you actively look for ways to serve them back?

This depth of relationship with nonhumans is actually common even in unhealthy cultures. Many people feel grateful for the unconditional joyful affection of their pet dogs or cats, and look for ways to give back to them. I've met a number of people who trust their dog or cat more than they trust other humans.

If you don't have a deep connection with other people, or a deep connection with Earth, 




### Can You Imagine Deeply Trusting the People Around You?

What is the biggest difference between a present-day Haudenosaunee, Cherokee, or another healthy-culture person who carries on their traditions, and your average American, Russian, or German?

All of them live under ruling-class laws, so none of them are free. Any of them can get a job or start families. What is the difference?

I believe the key difference is this: people of healthy cultures, even when recently forced to live under ruling-class laws, _remember what it is like when everyone in a nation has spiritual strength._ They remember how to live with integrity and bravery, how to cultivate deep awareness, and how to live in a way that enriches the Earth instead of trashing it. They remember how to cultivate that practical, aware gratitude, help each other give their sacred gifts, and live in reciprocity with each other and the Earth.

In other words, people of healthy cultures remember how to live where people have high standards for each other, or high expectations. In traditional times, people did not just expect each other to be pretty honest, but totally honest. People did not expect occasional generosity, but continual generosity. Even if many healthy cultures cannot fully live in a traditional way today, they carry that cultural memory that a beautiful way of life is possible, and many people live those ancient values as much as they can.

For the average American, Russian, or German, sometime in the past our ancestors stopped passing down those stories, so most of us don't carry that cultural memory of how to live in a good way, where people have high expectations of each other, and hold each other to a high standard of excellent and beautiful behavior.

Stories from healthy cultures show just how high our standards could be for each other.

#### A High Standard of Integrity

In every unhealthy-culture court system around the world, people are required to testify under oath, and they are threatened with severe punishment for lying. The assumption is that if participants weren't threatened with severe punishments, they might not tell the whole truth.

In contrast, integrity was so pervasive among the traditional Apache that they did not compel anyone to take such an oath. Apache man Geronimo told his biographer that, if a dispute escalated to a level that required community support to resolve, the chief would bring together the relevant people and witnesses to understand the issue and come to a decision. However, Geronimo said that "witnesses are not placed under oath, because it is not believed that they will give false testimony in a matter relating to their own people."[xxx-geronimo autobio|Unwritten Laws of the Apaches]

Can you imagine if there was no need for an oath to tell the truth, because people in your group already expected total honesty from each other as a normal way of life?

#### A High Standard of Physical Resilience

Crow woman Pretty Shield described how physically resilient her people were when they lived in a traditional way. She said, "Ahh, my people were tough in those days... [W]hen I was young, if in winter a person fell into icy water, he got out, took off his wet clothes, and rolled in the snow, rubbing his body with it, and got warm. Then, after squeezing out the water, he put on his clothes and forgot about getting wet. Now my people wear gloves, and too many clothes. We are soft as mud."[xxx-red mother|p84]

Can you imagine if the people around you were so physically resilient that even being soaking wet in winter was nothing to worry about, but just a little trouble to fix?

#### A High Standard of Generosity and Service

(Jesus Christ just seemed normal to people of healthy cultures)

Can you imagine if a missionary came to you with stories of an amazing man who gave away everything he had and dedicated his life to feeding the hungry, healing the sick, confronting injustice, and if your reponse was "Yeah, that's just how my people are. Jesus Christ sounds like just a normal good man."

#### A High Standard of Meaningful Education for Young People

One Nootka storyteller described how the women would often have their moon time at the same time each month, and they would go to a special house and enjoy a four-day party. They would sit on special soft moss and give their blood back to the Earth and play games and talk. Women would rub each others' back and make special tea if someone had cramps. This became a major opportunity for older women to mentor younger women. For example, young women learned the special Frog posture that could help relieve cramps and make childbirth easier.

Could you imagine if adults took young people's education seriously, offering them the most meaningful education and mentorship they could?

#### A High Standard of Benefitting the Earth

Stories abound of people of healthy cultures actually _benefitting_ the Earth as a normal way of life rather than depleting it. Robin Kimmerer described how traditional Potawatomi and Mohawk basket makers would respectfully harvest Black Ash trees to make their baskets, and Black Ash actually became _more abundant_ in regions where it was respectfully harvested, and this remains true today.[xxx-braiding sweetgrass|wisgaak gokpenagen] Apache man Stalking Wolf described in detail how he respectfully harvested a sapling to make a bow in such a way that the overall forest benefitted, and the chosen tree yielded a powerful bow.[xxx-the vision|p80]

Can you imagine if your normal way of life benefitted the Earth around you, increasing the natural abundance that you depended on?

When people really bring out the best in each other, have high expectations, or hold each other to a high standard, we humans really are capable of maintaining that baseline of mutual respect among each other, and between people and the Earth.

In a sense, the Potawatomi, Apache, Nootka, and Crow are people like anyone else. They have attitudes, skills and awareness that anybody could cultivate -- including you and the people around you.

You could hold yourself and the people around you to a high standard of integrity. You and the people around you could cultivate physical resilience, mentor young people in a good way, and learn how to receive the Earth's gifts in a way that actually benefits the Earth.

<div class="rev-act"><div class="rev-act-header">Revolutionary Activity #23<br/>Remember when you were held to a high standard</div>
<div class="rev-act-body">Think of a time when someone had faith in you, maybe even more faith than you had in yourself. Did someone help you find the self-respect to leave an abusive romantic relationship? Did a coach help you cultivate the discipline to train at your sport and be the best you could be? Did a teacher help you realize you could be great at whatever you put your mind to? Think of an example like this where someone really brought out the best in you, holding you to a high standard.<br/><br/>Now imagine being part of a group where everybody supported each other this way continually, in all areas of life. No one imposes their ideology on you, but they hold you to a high standard of excellent and beautiful behavior in your job, family life, social groups, and activism work, bringing out the best in you every day. And imagine you get to support others in the same way. How would that feel?</div></div>

### When People are discouraged from developing high standards and are rewarded for low standards, the outcome is dismal

Once people are conquered, and they accept being ruled in their unhealthy culture as normal and legitimate, _people's standards for themselves and each other drops a lot._ In other words, when a person or group finally considers it legitimate and ok to submit to authorities, they stop expecting very much of themselves or each other. People don't really expect life to be deeply meaningful, don't deeply trust others, or learn to focus mostly on themselves or pleasing others to keep life comfortable.

The underlying attitudes are things like, "Why bother cultivating deep integrity and bravery if I just want to keep my comfortable, predictable life and not rock the boat?" or "Why confront injustice if I don't trust others to stand with me, and if it wouldn't do any good anyway?"

As Part 2 showed, unhealthy cultures reward and encourage all our worst qualities, such as selfishness, cowardice, disconnection from each other and the Earth, ignorance, and superficiality. When people stop standing for what's right, and instead focus on keeping their job or wealth while staying out of trouble, these qualities can become widespread.

If a group of people wanted to form the seed of a new healthy culture, what would they need to do? In other words, what is a crucial early step on the path to the Deepest Revolution?

I believe one thing is crucial: _Hold yourself and others to the highest standards of excellent and beautiful behavior._

It takes deep spiritual strength to consistently hold yourself and others to such high standards. Fortunately, if you've been completing the revolutionary activities, you're already on the path of growing your spiritual strength.

### How to Cultivate Your Spiritual Strength, Regardless Your Unhealthy Culture




* connect with the Earth, with real gratitude and real ways of serving it

* connect with other people, where you feel real gratitude for them and find real ways of serving them.

* in other words, connect with people and nonhumans and form relationships where you really care about them -- where their wellbeing and aspirations matter to you.

Many parents spend vast amounts of time and energy on their children. They care about their children and find many ways of serving them -- helping them with schoolwork, mentoring, supporting them in playing sports or studying music. This comes from a place of deep caring.

Imagine caring just as much about people around you that you aren't related to, or caring just as much about the local population of deer, or a nearby river.

This is actually the normal depth of caring in healthy cultures, where people see divinity in every creature, and feel grateful for each creature's gifts. That's why Jenu Kuruba shaman JK Thimma said "who do you think will take care of the forest better? Us, who worship the animals, or you, who see the animals as wild and are frightened of them?"

Many adults lack deep connections with others where they can feel deeply invested and meaningfully act in service, and often their children become the only outlet for this attitude of service.

Parenting is one aspect of life where people can strongly influence someone else's life path (their kids') both for better or worse. But I believe in healthy cultures, adults feel as invested in each other as many parents do in their kids.     

Imagine being surrounded by people and nonhumans you cared about, and who cared about you, and you were really invested in their wellbeing. I think this is the normal way of life in a healthy culture.

The tragedy of unhealthy cultures is that, when they conquer healthy cultures, they do their best to destroy these deeply caring relationships between the people, and between the people and the Earth. Whether by forcing people out of the region entirely, as with the Cherokee Trail of Tears or Potawatomi Trail of Death, or imposing land ownership and then making land too expensive for most to own, or a thousand other ways, unhealthy cultures make it hard for people to form deep connections with the Earth.

And with all the divisiveness, the racism and sexism, the lazy thinking and foolish assumptions, the police that oppress solidarity movements and attack our spiritual leaders, and economies that reward selfishness, they make it hard for people to connect in ways where each person is deeply grateful for the other.

Is it any wonder attitudes of despair and hopelessness are so common? I actually believe these attitudes are widespread and people simply learn to ignore them.

When the Gumbaynggirr people in Australia worked to protect local forests from logging, even many locals who liked the idea didn't help much, with one saying, "

But ultimately, that depth of caring and connection with others is the source of spiritual strength. You have sacred gifts, but if you only serve yourself, why bother giving everything you have? But if you served others -- then your gifts start to really _matter_, and it matters how you show up in life.

Why did Jesus Christ keep serving his people even when he knew he would be killed for it? Why did Martin Luther King Jr keep serving his people even though he knew he would be killed for it? Ultimately, it's because they cared. 




* Have ever been around someone that you knew had potential, but they were holding back somehow? Maybe out of depression, or low self-worth, or self-centeredness. Whatever the reason, they were holding back. How did YOU feel noticing them hold back? Did it hurt? Did you feel upset noticing how much good this other person could do in the world, or how much joy they could be having, and instead they were tolerating depression, or a meaningless job, or an abusive or mediocre romantic relationship? 




The three core spiritual practices really are essential. If you don't care about other people or nonhumans, you'll never be motivated to...; You matter, and how you show up in life matters -- you have sacred gifts to give. But to whom will you give your gifts? To what cause, what people, what nonhumans? Why, the ones you love -- the ones you feel so grateful for that it would hurt not to serve them however you could.

And when you're giving your gifts from a place of gratitude for the people and nonhumans around you -- then you'll be living in reciprocity, where each person serves the wellbeing of the others, and collectively everyone benefits.
