## they remember life when everyone held each other to high standards

Even if the oppressive poverty, government schools, land theft, child kidnapping, and other troubles have made it difficult, they carry a memory of how to live properly with each other and the Earth. That means that if there is ever an opportunity for a successful Deep Revolution, people of healthy cultures are most likely to succeed, as they carry that cultural memory of how to live in a good way. The Zapatistas showed that people can pass this memory down for 500 years so that when it's time for revolution, that wisdom is available and the people are ready.

But if you're like me, you don't know anything about your healthy-culture ancestors. For me, some time in the distant past, my ancestors stopped passing down that ancient wisdom as they adjusted to life in their unhealthy culture.
