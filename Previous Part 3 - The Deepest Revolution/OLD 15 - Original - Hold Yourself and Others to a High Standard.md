## Chapter 16: (Original) Hold Yourself and Others to a High Standard

### When People Develop Low Standards

One universal consequence of being conquered is that _people's standards for themselves and each other drops a lot._ In other words, when a person or group finally accepts obedient submission, they stop expecting very much of themselves or each other. People don't really expect life to be deeply meaningful, or don't trust other people, or learn to focus mostly on themselves or pleasing others.

The underlying attitudes are things like, "Why bother cultivating deep integrity and bravery if I just want to keep my comfortable, predictable life and not rock the boat?" or "Why confront injustice if I don't trust others to stand with me, and if it wouldn't do any good anyway?"

As Part 2 showed, unhealthy nations reward and encourage all our worst qualities, such as selfishness, cowardice, disconnection from each other and the Earth, ignorance, and superficiality. When people stop standing for what's right, and instead focus on keeping their job or wealth while staying out of trouble, these qualities can become widespread.

If a group of people wanted to form the seed of a new healthy nation, what would they need to do? In other words, what is a crucial first step on the path to the Deepest Revolution?

I believe one thing is crucial: _Hold each other to the highest standards of excellent and beautiful behavior._

### Hold Yourself and Others to a High Standard

If you're like me, some of the Revolutionary Activities in this book probably seemed pretty easy, and some might have seemed a little intimidating. Finding a story of an admirable person may be relatively easy, but how difficult was it to notice when you hold back in fear, or stand in support of someone else who's "sticking their neck out" to do the right thing?

This book has invited you on a path of deep personal growth, cultivating the spiritual strength to give your deepest gifts and stand for what's right in whatever culture you're in. And I'll tell you from experience: it's hard to grow alone. It's so easy to think "why bother?" or "not right now" or "I don't feel like it."

That's because spiritual strength doesn't exist in isolation, but in relation to other people. Recall from Chapter 5 my definition of spiritual strength: giving your deepest love (or sacred gifts), and standing for what's right as a normal way of life.

Some aspects of personal growth have to happen alone. But to grow many aspects of that spiritual strength, you need other people. Why bother growing and releasing old patterns of shame, apathy, depression, or boredom if I'm the only one that cares or the only one that benefits? There need to be other people who care whether or not you're giving your gifts, or whether you're standing for what's right.

When other people care about you and care whether you're giving your deepest love, everything changes. Your sacred gifts start to _matter_ in a way they didn't before.

Imagine if you were surrounded by people who cared whether you were walking a meaningful path, and would not be satisfied if you tolerated boredom or superficiality. People who cared if you show up with integrity in your family and job. People who care if you're enjoying life, and cultivating a mutually enriching relationship with the Earth. Imagine if you told a little "white lie" to someone, and your group found out, and they told you you're better than that, and asked you to cultivate a deeper integrity so you could be utterly trustworthy to the people you most cared about.

And what if you could similarly bring out the best in the people around you, so that you and everyone in your group were on a path of strong personal growth, being your best selves, and cultivating deep relationships with each other and the Earth?

Imagine how much easier it would be to tackle life's challenges with others' support: to find and eat healthy food, to support pregnant families and young children, to support a loved one being unjustly persecuted by the legal system, to show up well in romantic relationships, to look for satisfying and meaningful paid work, to support a family member struggling with addiction, to learn how to garden and grow your own food.

Perhaps this group could help you with technical questions, such as about navigating the legal system or gardening. Or perhaps they can help you see when you're acting out of integrity and didn't even notice, and help you return to full integrity.

Your ancestors lived in a culture where people had close relationships with each other and the Earth. Unhealthy nations try to break those connections, so part of the path of healing is to form new close connections with other people and the Earth where people bring out the best in each other and hold each other to a high standard.

Do not start or join such a group hoping to be part of a fully sovereign healthy nation or fantasizing about living in a utopia someday. This would be a sure path to disappointment. Simply help each other live a life of excellence and beauty right now, in service of each other and the Earth.

<div class="rev-act-body">Co-found or join a group committed to deep personal and collective growth. This requires at least one other person besides yourself, such as a spouse or close friend. Have each person commit to holding themselves and each other to a high standard, helping each other find a meaningful life path and walk it, standing for what's right if anyone misbehaves, helping each other if anyone is threatened, sharing with each other, and cultivating a mutually enriching relationship with the Earth.</div></div>

### A Group's Collective Sense of Right and Wrong is the Source of Natural Law

At first, I did not understand when the Haudenosaunee writers said that their "society was founded on concepts of moral justice, not statute law." How is that even possible? Isn't written statute law fundamental? Don't people need to make clear written agreements so that everyone knows how to live?

Consider what happens when a group of people start having high expectations of each other and really holding each other to a high standard of good behavior. What happens when each person helps the others give their deepest love in life rather than holding back and accepting boredom or apathy?

When people really expect the best out of each other, they end up deciding for themselves what behavior is ok and what isn't -- and that's actually what law is. But instead of trying to capture every nuance of every possible situation in written law, and then arguing endlessly over legal minutia, people learn collectively trust their own deep sense of right and wrong and cultivate mutual understanding so that if someone acts hurtfully, the group can address it and return to that baseline of mutual respect.

In other words, when everyone stands for what's right as a normal way of life and expects others to do the same, the peope come to an understanding of what's ok and what's not ok.

Ultimately, I believe this is the source of rules in healthy nations: when everyone in a group expects everyone else to give their deepest love and stand for what's right as a normal way of life, they end up with high standards of excellent behavior that let them live with a baseline of mutual respect.

I believe this is what it means to have a society founded on moral justice instead of statute law. People can obviously still make agreements with each other, and should have high standards of integrity to keep those agreements. But it's hard to make agreements that cover every possible future situation, and sometimes a situation arises where a past agreement is out of place. If by some strange circumstance a past agreement would keep people from seeking justice, or from helping each other during a difficult time, prioritize justice and mutual aid.

### What Aspects of Healthy Cultures Will Your Group Embody?

If you want to accomplish anything meaningful, you have to commit to your goal before you know how to achieve it. So if you don't know how to do any of these following commitments, that's fine. But if you really decide...

* Commit to learning about the nonhuman life around you and cultivating a reciprocal relationship with the Earth, so that the Earth is better off because of your presence

* Commit to a path of deep personal growth together. In practice, this means holding yourself and others to a high standard of excellent and beautiful behavior, including things like generosity, integrity, gratitude, giving your sacred gifts, and enjoying life.

* Help each other notice little moments of selfishness, of "closing down" or "holding back" somehow, and learn how to show up better.

* Every time someone doesn't meet your high standards, avoid any shame or put-downs, consider what lesson they can learn, and help them learn it so the group can maintain those high standards. In other words, really bring out the best in each other.

* Commit to sharing with each other and supporting each other if anyone is in need or under threat

If you and even a small group of people could make and keep these commitments to each other, consider what aspects of healthy nations your group would embody:

* _baseline of mutual respect_: Your group would have a baseline of mutual respect internally, like healthy nations.

* _close, reciprocal relationship with the Earth_

* _your own internal standards of good behavior_: "Law" is simple a culture's standards of appropriate and inappropriate behavior. When you and your group hold each other to high standards, you're setting your standards of welcome and unwelcome behavior. In effect, you're creating your own law within the group.

Almost every organization does this, including militaries, corporations, government departments, and sports teams -- the group decides on the standards they'll hold each other to, and in effect create their own internal rules. In your group, I'm merely suggeting you hold each other to the highest standards to really bring the best out of everybody.

* _generosity_: Within the group, sharing becomes normal. Because each person holds the others to a high standard, you're able to avoid selfishness, so nobody will mooch off of others' generosity.

* _trust_: when people commit to that high standard of integrity, trust will become common. People can trust each other to speak the truth and keep promises. Likewise with integrity of service: when people in your group show up for each other in times of need, whether in times of joblessness, legal persecution, or other trouble, you can really relax knowing people in your group will take care of each other no matter what comes.

    You won't have full freedom yet, as your unhealthy nation still imposes its laws. But your group will have its own laws, its own standards of excellent behavior, and people will expect you to uphold them rather than punishing you for it. 

* _spiritual strength_: as the group helps each person learn to give their sacred gifts and stand for what's right, people will really cultivate a deep spiritual strength.

### Spiritual Strength and the Deepest Revolution

There have been plenty of shallow revolutions in history, where one ruling class just replaces another and the lives of most people don't change much.

After the Deepest Revolution, there isn't a ruling class anymore. The people agree on their laws and uphold them as a normal way of life. People take care of each other and stand for what's right as a normal way of life. In other words, spiritual strength will be widespread.

If there is any kind of revolution or civil war, and people have not cultivated their spiritual strength and unity, then the revolution will be shallow, and little good will come of it.

So cultivate your spiritual strength and support others in growing as well. No one can know the future. But if you work with others to build a foundation of spiritual strength now, you can protect the Earth and each other for as long as your unhealthy nation lasts. And when the time is ripe, you will be ready for the Deepest Revolution.

****

You and others will keep fucking up, learn to forgive. Make the relationships, and keep tending it.

Agree to the standards and hold each other to them.
